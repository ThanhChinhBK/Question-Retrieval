Yet the new generation is also going crazy enrolling in IT degrees... How many IT jobs you think there are in this place? Unix and Linux are jobs for men in here.. Yes believe me; certain jobs are dedicated for each gender... an IT company that needs a Unix admin; that is 99.99% male dominated department would NEVER hire a woman.

Exactly in these case you are the victim; same thing happen with our company driver got 6000/- fine for signal jumping I suggest you go and request to staff of the traffic department may be they can consider your request.

Do u still have the car? when this happened? Check 3-4 days after incident on MOI web site. If amount is there on the car number during the period u have rented then rent car company will recover from you. did they block a specified amount from your credit card? Go to muroor (traffic deptt) and meet the captain on immediate basis and beg him. the violation can be seen in the screen there.He might show pity and reduce it. That is the only way money can be reduced. Arabic speaking person is required for speaking in muroor.	1

There is an appeal committee in muroor who will accept the appeals. They sit two or three days in a week. Prepare an appeal explaining the case (of course in Arabic). Then they will consider the case and fine may be reduced to QR. 1500 or even less.	1

Does anyone know what the penalty is for jumping on the red light? Thanks!	Arrange International Driving Licence before leaving India. With the permission of Qatar Traffic Dept I think u can drive car till u r getting RP. After than u have to pass out the driving test ( 7 days min / 25 days & 40 days full class cost around QR 2000 / )which is little tough here. In most of the driving school waiting list upto 2 months. Wish u all the best.	0
Does anyone know what the penalty is for jumping on the red light? Thanks!	"...a horrible death in a mass of mangled metal. The law of averages is not on your side. The more you do it; the sooner you will end up on a slab. The fine is irrelevant. If you're still here to pay it then you should count yourself lucky. If you search ""road accidents in Qatar"" on youtube you will see a video of what happened when a Landcruiser jumped a signal and got obliterated by a truck doing 80kmh. Not pretty. Stork."	0

Dear and beloved brother in Islam; it is not the concept of banking per say which is forbidden in Islam; but it is the concept and dealings of ‘riba’ which forms the very back-bone of conventional interest-based banks; which is absolutely forbidden in Islam by Allah and His Messenger (saws). The Islamic Banks or Islamic Financial Institutions are all based on Shariah-compliant interest-free dealings; and it would be absolutely permissible for a believer to seek employment in an Islamic Bank; if he wishes to do so. Islamic way of banking: Most people are so used to the conventional interest-based banking system; that in their ignorance of the laws of Shariah-compliant Islamic Economics they may at times accuse the Islamic Financial Institutions of dealing in interest or ‘riba’ with just a different name. A simple example can be cited to make the concept of ‘haraam’ and ‘halaal’ clearer. If one marries a woman and satisfies his pleasure; it is considered ‘halaal’ and .....	1

Dear people in Islam thankyou every one of you for your valuable answers. i did a little research on this topic and i came to know that; no matter whatever the banks are. if their capital has riba involved in it and if the banks are dealing with riba ; then the business is haram. it depends on what they are dealing with. for example - all ''Q'' companies are dealing and doing business with some product so their business is halal but when some company does liquor and riba and other haram things involved in it ; then it becomes haram. i also found this that: in olden days the trade used to take place between products like rice for wheat; or rice for milk or rice for sugar or other dealings which is halal; then came currency : wheat for dirhams; dirhams for rice which still is halal but when the currency came in like 1 kg of good quality gold for 3 kg of bad quality gold and people started this thing and started to cheat in this currency to currency to gold to gold ; or good quality wheat.....	0

Has anyone needed to use QAWS recently? If so what was your experience?	Why do you want to know? Any particular reason?	0

Has anyone needed to use QAWS recently? If so what was your experience?	"I think what they meant was ""has anyone had the need to call upon the assistance of QAWS recently?"". Please remember that QAWS is NOT a commercial company; we are not paid to do this; and we receive no funding other then private donations!! We offer assistance to animals that need help because we care about them. It's a vocation - not a job."	0
Has anyone needed to use QAWS recently? If so what was your experience?	I am trying to contact them and am not getting any answer by phone or email	0
Has anyone needed to use QAWS recently? If so what was your experience?	If you mean if any one has adopted from QAWS recently. Then our experience was not so Good. We unfortunately adopted a kitten that had ringworms and had rash on her nose and other parts of the body. The new kitten gave all of the family ringworm rash leaving permanent marks on the body from this. We have had her treated and now she is fine. Where as we fully understand that QAWS is a fully voluntry organisation; but we feel that they could have advised us more about the health of the little kitten.	1
Has anyone needed to use QAWS recently? If so what was your experience?	"Ukeng; I think you were told that this kitten had been suffering from ringworm; in fact if I remember rightly you were asked to return at a later date when it had cleared up. If I remember we said ""as far as we can tell it has recovered"". Not being vets we have NEVER told an adopter that the animal they are adopting is 100% fully fit and healthy unless they have been to a vets. We have apologised for any inconvenience and even offered to take the kitten back into the shelter which you declined. It's just a shame that the one or two negative experiences people have seem to overwhelm the hundreds of animals we rescue and rehome successfully."	0
Has anyone needed to use QAWS recently? If so what was your experience?	comachero - Apologies; I have been away on vacation and I'm in the process of working through the 90 odd emails all asking for assistance! I will get to you as soon as possible!!	0
Has anyone needed to use QAWS recently? If so what was your experience?	Ah Comenchero; that would be my fault... Between my actual work(that sponsors me here); running around for the rescue; trying to help out other members on the committee with their business while they were out of the country; dealing with a friend of mine who was having a relationship and emotional breakdown... I am terribly sorry that I didn't get around to answering your phone calls or checking your emails. As Chelsea has said; we do this out of the goodness of our hearts and no one seems to appreciate how much time of our own we give for these animals - and we seem to get nothing in return but negative feed back... Someone will get back to you - we are only 4 people trying to do the best we can - give us a break!!!!	0
Has anyone needed to use QAWS recently? If so what was your experience?	Chelsea. I don't mean to dent QAWS reputation any way. As I mentioned that we just had a bad experience. Let me get this straight. It was we who requested that if you would take the Kittens back; which you kindly accepted to do. Again Thankyou. All I am trying to highlight here as you have said that you are only a Voluntry Body and not a Veternary service and those who are considering to adopt should have this in their mind.	1
Has anyone needed to use QAWS recently? If so what was your experience?	Comanchero... apologies.. that would be my fault.... Between my actual job (that sponsors me here); making sure that the rescue has everything it needs; running one of the other committee members companies so it didn't go belly up while she and her family where out of the country; dealing with a dear friends emotional breakdown and the breakdown of her relationship; as well as trying to give my own dogs and people in my life attention - I am sorry that I haven't had time to answer your phone calls or tend to your emails. WE are 4 people - 2 were away and those left here; had to try deal with everything that was thrown at us. We are terribly sorry if you feel neglected; like we haven't been at attention when you needed us. Sarcastic; yes; but I think we have all had it with people whinging when things go wrong and never giving credit where credit is due.... Please try to remember; as Chelsea has said - we are not a charity; nor are we governement funded - we do this because we love anim.....	0

Mr. Golliwog was my favorite toy... ..now I hear in the U.S. it is totally not P.C. buy your child a one - or even call them golliwogs. I loved mine. x mp	The players decide who goes first; perhaps via ip dip; (American: Eeny; meeny; miny; moe) or a variant; then the jacks are scattered loosely into the play area. The players take it in turn to bounce the ball off the surface; then pick up jacks; then catch the ball before it bounces twice. There are variants on this procedure. Sometimes the ball is thrown into the air rather than bounced. Sometimes it is bounced against a wall or target; if that is in the vicinity of play. Sometimes no bounce is allowed at all. In some variants; the players must pick up as many jacks as possible in each turn. Perhaps more commonly; the number of jacks to be picked up is pre-ordained and sequential: at first you must pick up one (onesies); next two (twosies); and so on. In most versions of the game; only one hand may be used. To simplify play; both may be used; to make it harder; or to impose a handicap; a player might be required to use their off-hand (eg; the left if right-handed). http://en.wikipedia......	0

I am in the process of shifting between two apartments from two different landlords. This means I'll need to terminate the kahramaa contract for the old apartment and start a new one; is this something you can do in a single step process? If you have done this before; what is the best way of doing it?	find kahrama office service depending on you area .. you need to cancel the first contract and the initiate new one .. not two birds in one shot .. cancellation procedures : 1- take photo of the meter reading of electrisity and water both .. 2-fill up the form of cancellation 3- copies of your identity cards 4-copy of your tenancy contract 5-copy of gurantee slip (2000)QR then they will calculate your balance and issue check QNB or you have to pay in case your previous payments exceeds the limit of 2000 QR advanced; next step initiate new account ... same procedure when you applied first time ... goodluck :))	1

I have to go to the old apartment; take pictures of their current readings; then go kahramaa offices (D-Ring) with a copy of my ID and the new leasing agreement. All I have to pay is the difference between the last bill and the current readings (since I don't have any outstanding balances with them) Sounds (too) easy - wish me luck! :)	0

Hi everyone; I'm recently moved to Doha with the family and was looking to buy some property. Does anybody have experienced buying place in new Lusail project.

I'd appreciate any information & opinion about buying property in Doha and Lusail specifically. Don't you think that the prices already overlooked? What are estimation on development of that area? Thanks	1. If this is to be bought as a long-term investment (over ten years); do you believe there will be sustained growth beyond the current property bubble? 2. What are the threats that exist to current property values in Doha? Can you foresee any international conflicts in the next two years that could wipe out the current property boom? 3. What will be the effect in the medium term (five to ten years) of continued property development on prices? 4. Are there reliable data on how the expatriate population will grow over the next five to ten years? Do you know whether there will be a growth in single people versus families; or vice versa. How will this affect demand for flats versus villas? 5. Is the current property boom caused by real demand; or by an increase in liquidity in Qatar because of high crude prices? 6. What is the proposed lifespan for the development? Is this lifespan supported by structural engineers reports? 7. If buying a property before completion; is it likely that it w.....	1

I'd appreciate any information & opinion about buying property in Doha and Lusail specifically. Don't you think that the prices already overlooked? What are estimation on development of that area? Thanks	Ngourlay makes some very good points that any person thinking of investing should seriously consider. I've been looking into the number of people coming to Qatar and the supply of property for some time. What is interesting is that demand is likely to continue to outstrip supply for the next 4-5 years. After this point; the Pearl; Lusail and other developments will come fully on stream and then I suspect property prices will come down as there will be enough supply. But on the other hand; Qatar is similar to how Dubai was in the mid 1990s. The potential is really impressive in the long term so real estate in Qatar is a good investment. As far as Lusail goes - I've consistently heard that it is running behind schedule and will not be completed on time. The first new development which will be ready seems to be the Zig Zag towers in June/July. They still have a couple of apartments left near the top I hear so it might be a better investment than Lusail given delays etc.....	1

Thanks	You should not compare it to Dubai since prices in dubai when they statred selling 5 years ago were low and there was a big potential for buying; in Doha; a 2 bed appartment is selling for the same price as in dubai now; so even though there will be some upward potential; i dont think its enough to take the risk second; when i first came here in january i was interested in buying and i went to see the buildings with al sabban towers and they said that out of three towers they still have one to be sold; 6 months later they still had few appartment in that same tower; and now they are also selling the other two which were still not sold; in dubai; a compound of 6000 villa was sold in three days. third; between the pearl and lusail and waab cilty finishing all together; i dont think that doha is ready to fill all these empty appartments with such an inflation and people are starting to lok for other alternatives than doha I always tell the truth; even when I lie	1

Thanks	I have brought on the zig Zag about 7 months ago; and it has gone up so say 300;000 ryals. Not bad I hear you say but its paper money till you sell it; and I don't yet see an emerging sales market. Personally I am torn now; sell when the towers are finished take a quick profit OR Rent and hold on to it long term. Right now I am looking at the former; if i can make even 200;000 I am happy as that is more than the bank would have given me. We shall see; I would recommend zig zag purely because it will be finished first; the Pearl looks good long term and will be desirable. If al Wabb is cheap then great; get in. Loisil well that really is a lonnnnng way off; at least 5 years in my opinion before it would be worth it. but as a long term bet it could be good and might actually be a better bet than the Pearl as I think that NOW its over priced. Some friends got in when prices were lower; but now is is crazy money and there will be A LOT of towers down there.	1

Thanks	"Dear aviduser; actually the same question as already posted by navi ...""what is the situation for residence permit?"" are you getting it straight after the purchasing property or need to wait until it's completion; or even something else. How is the law and rules work here? You advise will be very valid for me; since I'm too new for this place. Congrats; for your purchase but now I'm totally confused whether it's worthy to look for Lusail or not? All these buildings won't be finished before 2010;so no return from any of the investment upon that time; which makes bank loan too heavy for me. Any approximate expectation on rental prices for ZigZag? What is the actual prices now for apartments in these towers since you already planning to sell them soon? Thanks."	0

This all sounds great I know but I am thinking that if you tell an employer you don't need to be sponsored they may not hire you as they have less control over you. In my case getting rid of the Exit permit thing is a big bonus. Zig Zag two beds are up now for about 1.9 million they were 1.6 Rental returns well I don't know; compared to Beverly Hills tower where the average is 18K I am hoping for 14-16K Hopefully. Loisil is so long away the financing in this country does not make any sense. Dubai was mentioned earlier; what people fail to mention with that ""boom"" is flats were offered with very low down payments and then nothing until completion. This meant people with enough cash could secure hundreds of apartments each they then sold the options on these flats on for a little profit and on the cycle went; with only the person holding the flat at the c....."	1

In some of the bathrooms you open the door 3cm and it hits the toilet bowl! I recently sold an apartment at The Pearl and made a million riyals profit. I bought it early on. The prices have gone up a lot. _______________________________________________________ Love is the answer...	0

That will be forfeited which is no big deal. But since you have issued cheques that will now be bouncing you will have a criminal record in the GCC. So coming to Qatar; and perhaps any other GCC country; might potentially lead to you being arrested. Bouncing cheques is taken very seriously.	1

hey guys; i applied for a job in qatar n the salary might be around 9000 Ryals; they will provide me an appartment; do you think it's good enough for me to live there and save some money? thank you	It all depends on your lifestyle and what you are coming for. You can blow off 9000Qr in a week; a month; or be able to save up to 4000 QR out of it per month. You can rent a car for around 1600-1800 QR per month; but I would recommend buying a second hand car or a brand new one if you plan to stay here for 3-4 years; and you can pay around 750-1000QR per month and own the car. For food and personal expenses; 2000-3000QR is what you need so you will end up having 1000QR to shop with ; and 4000QR to save! Email me if you need more info; use my profile to email me. Cheers!	1

Hi everyone im in the process of negotiating my salary but i have no idea how much should be the salary of mechanical engineer with grade 5 in a government company and the benefits. This will be my first time in qatar. Kindly help me. Thanks in advance.	You should ask yourself how much you will need to live a decent life. That would require some research on the cost of living in Qatar. Once you've done that you should add an amount you are planning to save. Then you can demand that amount and if they don't accept it you shouldn't bother to come here.	0

Hi everyone im in the process of negotiating my salary but i have no idea how much should be the salary of mechanical engineer with grade 5 in a government company and the benefits. This will be my first time in qatar. Kindly help me. Thanks in advance.	One of the major dilemma a prospective employee faces is his / her salary requirement. During the interview process; an applicant realise how good he / she was in answering questions being raised. An applicant should be able to impress HR that he is not only the best candidate but the only suitable candidate for the job. If you are able to impress HR then you can demand. How much you are worth? It all depends on YOU. Every company has a salary scale (minimum - maximum) for each and every job however; if you are worth more; demand. Chances are; you can get it; depending on YOU.	0

So rather than speaking to HR; may be you should ask your manager about it (if you are in contact with him/her). It is not a systematic entitlement but it was fairly easy to get where I used to work (gvt)	0

Salam; I am mechanical Eng. 15 years experience; i got a job for Rasgas co. direct hire; I am married and i have 2 kids; 5 & 3 years old.my life style is average . is 8.000 QR enaugh as a basic salary ? if you know; please tell me what another benefits ? is it good to join Rasgas initially on single status for 6 months; then change to family status? please help me urgently.	If the salary includes other benefits; such as accommodation & transportation; then I think that would be enough...initially. Try to scout among your peers during your probationary period and request from there if there is such a need to ask for an increment and/or is it really feasible to bring your family here. Hope it would be of help pal.	1

Depends on your position. 8;000 QR is quite less for an engineer. Most of Oil/Gas companies in Qatar gives up to 6 months probation periods; it depends upon your performance; maybe for only 3 months; you will get hired already as regular employee. After that; then you can bring your family in Qatar. For the other benefits; I have no idea; but probably its good because Rasgas is a big company. O.T.. When did you get the interview in Rasgas? I am waiting also.	1

I agree with the answer at the top. QR8k is much to small with 15 years of experience for engineer is Rasgas. If other stuff such as accomodation and schools are provided than you will do just fine.	1

VNINOH And everyone else - RASGAS Co. First up; congrats on the offer mate; a quick word; RASGAS is a very good company and standards of work and culture are pretty nice... Now coming to your question... The salary that they offer you with QR 8K Basic (having 15yrs of experience) is a TOTAL CRAP...HEAR ME MY FRIEND With that kinda experience I would say a BARE MINIMUM SALARY OF 15000 QR...at a Company like Rasgas...and this my friend is purely purely Basic; cos they normall provide Housing at their Al-Khor Community for Employees and life in there is quite nice; Schooling is covered for your children; yearly air tickets for you and family; MEdical Insurance for you and members of your family; and other such extra perks and yearly bonuses and appraisals are all not included... QR 15000K is a Bare minimum; by the way having said this; whats the position...but irrespective of that; QR 8000 is just a total waste; and DO NOT ACCEPT IT! I'm not being racist here; but for other Nationalities .....	1

Hi I am an engineer having 16 yrs experience recently came to qatar. 8 K Basic is really very very bad salary; according to me don't accept it. Even if they provide free accomodation housing; education for kids; air ticket for family; medical etc your saving potential will maximum 5k per month; for that you no need to come here and work with rasgas.

Hi; What are your thoughts on a Grade 6 with Qatar Airways at 8500 QAR plus transport allowance. Accommodation is provided. I am British. My initial at how low the salary offer was. what are your thoughts?	What department is this is in? And is this your first job? If it isn't and you don't need the experience I wouldn't bother that salary is rubbish and wont go very far here	1

Hi; What are your thoughts on a Grade 6 with Qatar Airways at 8500 QAR plus transport allowance. Accommodation is provided. I am British. My initial at how low the salary offer was. what are your thoughts?	it IS less than what I am on now! I am considering turning down the offer; because the salary level is wayyyy below my expectation. I have a secure job in the UK - and I would have to give this up in return for not being any better off. I get the feeling there is room for negotiation; but the chances of them doubling the initial offer is unlikely; I was looking at more towards 14;000 up to 18;000.	0

I am seriously considering working for Qatar Airways but don't seem to be able to find out what kind of flight benefits they offer for their employees and family.

Each employee is entitled to a free return air ticket within QR network for herself/himself; and her/his family (depending on one's grade). Which class they are entitled to is also dependent on the grade. They are also entitled to purchase discounted tickets; but that is on sub-load basis meaning the the seats are not confirmed and one could be bumped out in the last moment in case flights are full. It's an industry practice.	1

On the contract; you will find everything you need to know about your salary and benefits so I'm wondering why you are so confused. I don't recommend you to take the housing allowance hence accept the accommodation that QA will provide for you. If you are a bachelor; you don't need to spend 10K for a flat. I don't get most of your point. Sorry. cheers; paul	0

I cannot imagine a world with out email; internet; and other things. So if the service provider have no problem providing the service then Qtel should not have problem with it. Btw we dont pay for adsl line just for fun its for the use of such technologies...!!! You need privatization in qatar. If there can be 2 to 3 more telecom companies i am sure no one will go with Qtel if they ever decide to block VOIP tech. ARGGHHH!!!	0
What the crap is this retarted attitude of QTEL to block audio video conversation????	Ahh; I can't get my VoIP working... Anyone know if it's still blocked?!? I'm from Canada; and can't call back home... well I can with huge unnecessary bills. The port blocking is so retarded -- Give people firewalls if they want it; don't impose random retarded ones on everyone !	0

Has anyone had this procedure done here in Doha and can you give any referrals?	probably that would be LASER SURGERY... ~~~ We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp and some are dull; some are pretty; some have weird names and all are of different colors; but they all have to learn to live in the same box.~~~	0

Has anyone had this procedure done here in Doha and can you give any referrals?	I set up an appointment for an initial consultation at Maghrabi (sp?) inside the Al Ahli Hospital. The cost for first visit is 300 QAR. I'll let you know how it goes.	1
Has anyone had this procedure done here in Doha and can you give any referrals?	due to the fact that one dr for the consultation and then a separate traveling doctor (doctor that is only in Qatar periodically) performs the surgery. I am not comfortable with this as he would not be around later if there are complications; and if there were; he could not be held responsible as he could just never return to Qatar.	0

""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing"" - Edmund Burke I'd say that is evident. What say you?"	Good. i see that we agree. Now; do tell; what are you actually DOING ?	1
""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing"" - Edmund Burke I'd say that is evident. What say you?"	"Like the old proverb goes ""The person who dosen't speak out against the wrong is a mute devil"" Forbidding and condemning an evil is just as important as enjoining and condoning the good. The more the world is bereft of such beings then truly we are in great peril and calamities are bound to occur with injustice becoming widespread! And one should not hesitate to speak out against the wrong and/or the wrongdoer regardless of who he/she/they maybe; even if they be their most beloved companion and/or closest of kin!"	1
""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing"" - Edmund Burke I'd say that is evident. What say you?"	Suffice to say I do try hard night and day to practice this mantra and even encourage those around me to do so; regardless of what we may have to endure of hardship and loss.	1
""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing"" - Edmund Burke I'd say that is evident. What say you?"	It means that evil is like a disease and is not neutral! If you stop resisting to a disease (not taking medicine against it for example);it will continue to grow and spread. To fight against a disease; you need medicine... To fight against evil; you need to wake up and do something! . . . PS: -Be cool and put that wooden spear down! :)	1
""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing"" - Edmund Burke I'd say that is evident. What say you?"	Good. I lead by example. BUT; here is the problem...there is still too much evil...so; what do we do?	1
""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing"" - Edmund Burke I'd say that is evident. What say you?"	And shame in doing evil; then we needn't/shouldn't have fear or shame in doing what's right and just. What we lack sometimes is the courage or maybe we fear the breaking of ties or loss of some worldly benefits. Or maybe we feel we will not be able to bear the pressure and commitment that may come once we take that path of speaking out against a wrong. The solution then is to first overcome these fears and know that by our keeping quiet not only will a wrong doer get off Scott free and a crime go unpunished; but we may very well find ourselves in the place of the victim next; with no one to speak for us!	1
""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing"" - Edmund Burke I'd say that is evident. What say you?"	let the men wear full viel and ladies to roam naked	0
""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing"" - Edmund Burke I'd say that is evident. What say you?"	"Draccy; YES. And I am sure all will agree. Funny thing is; they will remain passive...saying ""What can we do"" ? That suggests they need a leader; a leader that tells them what to do. Seems there is no one around though. And things are left for others to deal with...others; who don't really have anything to do with the problem in the first place. others; who; due to circumstance; don;t know what kind of evil they are dealing with...hence; are losing one battle after the other. Which leads us to the conclusion that those who are leaderless and ask ""what can we do"" are part of the problem.Non?"	1
""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing"" - Edmund Burke I'd say that is evident. What say you?"	Edmund Burke was an evil man	0
""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing"" - Edmund Burke I'd say that is evident. What say you?"	I say you still continue and don't give up. Yes at times it may seem overwhelming and perhaps despite your efforts an evil will still go unpunished; but at least you know then that you had no part to play in the affair.	1

I don't think the problem is with HMC as far utilising the medical city building is concerned; but i don't know the details. Similarly; housing allowance is provided to everybody who is eligible or who's contract states housing allowance. One problem facing HMC is that it had hired lot of staff in 2 years; mostly females; all of them now want to bring in their families and get a house from HMC. This ain't easy.	1

So who is responsible for holding up 2000 flats in a rising rents market? HMC alone."	Jackmphan They are know thinking about including the single status in the contract. I am just putting everything into picture; HMC hired many nurses in last 2 years. When they came they were offered either housing or housing allowance. Almost all took housing allowance; then they called their families on visit visa; once their husbands found a job in qatar; they want to forfeit housing allowance and instead they want a house from HMC. This means thousands of units and this is not an easy job and plus estimate the rent. By and large HMC has been favourable to its employs; i know many hospitals in gulf do not allow females to bring their families. Plus not so long ago; no organization in qatar was even giving housing allowance to females; they either get single accomodation or nothing at all.	1

can someone fill me in on the story with palm tree island?	Nice beautiful; if a bit unkept; manmade Island which served quite rightly to provide enterteinment to the desperate families who coldn´t afford to pay or couldn´t get into an expensive healthclub. Once day; someone very clever decides to destroy it; leaving instead a piece of sand with one tree in the middle. Rumours have been circulating about the next project that will take its place: a fountain; an acuatic IKEA; a swim-thru McDonals; the tallest building ever made; etc...but so far; nothing has happened and most probably nothing will ever replace that little oasis of entertainment in a city where there is absolutely nothing to do.	1
can someone fill me in on the story with palm tree island?	Once upon a time it was a small island with a little fun fair and some entertainment for faimlies. Than from one day to the other everything just disappeared; except one single tree. Rumours say that it was for the safety of the Doha Asian Games. But so far nothing is there; and I don't know if there will be ever again...	1
can someone fill me in on the story with palm tree island?	Two years ago; when I came to this country...someone lured me to go this this island one weekend. It costs only 20riyals (to and from the island; includes the entrance fee; i suppose)drow boat ride. There you can relax in a lounger under the shade of the trees; watching the others swin; play volleyball or the children play in the sand. And since the beach side faces to the sea...you'll feel like you're in a tropical island away from QATAR (my opinion). waiters are ready to take your food order. Read a book while you smoke sheesha. If you get hungry; there was a seafood restaurant for you to dine in... It was my small heaven; my recluse whenever I feel homesick; work-stressed or just plain lazy to do anything... NOW...IT'S JUST AN EMPTY ISLAND...and the tree there is not even a PALM TREE? :-( What you are is what you have been; and what you will be is what you do now. - Buddha	1

can someone fill me in on the story with palm tree island?	"I think it was a great loss to Doha when they demolished that Island. It was such a wonderful place to be in. They also did not provide any information to the public about the reason behind this decision. I guess they could have easly said: ""because qatarisun & her/his partner have split up"" :-) But butterfly; there are still many places to go to here & many things to do in Doha. I don't think ""there is absolutely nothing to do in this city"" (Azi; as you can see; I AM able to discuss things wisely with no bashing...but hushhhh...dont tell anybody)"	1
can someone fill me in on the story with palm tree island?	"""there are still many places to go to here & many things to do in Doha"" Of course there are; the parks and the malls and if you can spend the money; the expensive hotel´s beach clubs.

can someone fill me in on the story with palm tree island?	this is Air Supply/non-westerner/The Che....(banned 14 times so far) What's wrong with parks; malls and driving away from Doha? Actually if you chose not to spend much money in these places; it is easy to do it (for people with limited income)(I agree they don't have much nice free beaches in Doha) And if you want to spend money; what's wrong in going to fancy clubs & hotels? Isn't all this/the above the facts about a simple city life? To have these varieties? How about the lovely Souqs with their wonderful cafes? You will enjoy them so much & spend very little. Who wants noisy nightclubs; they are available. Who want a quiet glass of wine; it's available (Golf Club for example); who wants a park; an old Souq; Cafes; Malls; Shops; far beeches; exclusive beeches...all available. Damn! Why did they demolish the Palm Island! It used to be my favorite place!	0
can someone fill me in on the story with palm tree island?	For someone like me (who grew up in a place where you just cross the road from your house and you reach the beach); one whole day or afternoon in Palm Tree Island makes me feel I'm back home.

Been to nearly every corner of Qatar. And everything just sand and sand. Palm tree island one of my favourite place to take the kids. The beach there a bit rocky; but still better than nothing. There used to be a public beach next to Oasis; and now the build another hotel there (Sharq). Beach in Al Wakra not that good ... the only decent beach is inland sea which is quite long drive from Doha."	0

This happened in apartments on LSU's campus. It had nothing to do with racism. Unfortunately for these two young men the police believe it was a home invasion. That is the first story that they came out with. The second report in that a fellow classmate who had been kicked out of the university did this. By the way; the suspect is also from India. So please don't go crying racism. This is a terrible thing that has happened. Pray for the victims and their families. One of the gentlemen was married and thankfully his wife was out at the time of the crime.	1

In my North American university they had the system of averaging out the grades. (It is a very complicated system; you cannot understand it and neither did I). So what happened was that I was failing; and in order to pass I needed to put all the other nerds in the course to sleep. But those jerks would study all day and never sleep and I was very much worried about the health effects on them for not sleeping. In the end I told my professor of the Pressure on those students; so he gave all of them A Grades and me got B grade. Here is what happened in the exam. After one hour had passed in the exam; he told us if anyone of you wants to leave; he can leave and he will get a B. So I happily left. I was the only one to leave. For the rest who stayed he gave all of them A for believing in themselves.	0

You cant get 1005 silk sarees in Bombay silks; Dulhan or the saree shop in Lulu centre.    Are you going to ware it as saree or to stitch some dress with that saree (many arab woman do that) You get good quality embroidered silk clothes in AL Dana centre in the souq	1

hi. am from india n will leaving to doha soon so could anybody tell me the dresscode preferably for ladies between the age group of 23-28 yrs. are there any kind of restrictions in wearing sarees?	Generally so long as u wear decent clothing u'll be fine. I notice sometimes the tops worn with sarees leave the stomach bare - this might not be a wise idea unless you're going to a meet where you know there'll be other INdians; as locals don't tend to appreciate a bare stomach.	1

hi. am from india n will leaving to doha soon so could anybody tell me the dresscode preferably for ladies between the age group of 23-28 yrs. are there any kind of restrictions in wearing sarees?	"""dress like you guys dress in India"" dude thats some really bad advice for someone coming to Qatar...most of the attire worn by women dotting the cosmopolitan landscape in India would raise eyebrows and drop jaws all over Qatar...any ways the motto here is kiss...keep it straight and sober... Sarees are totally acceptable...anything and everything that covers you till your knees and elbows is fine...just listen to greater reason...this is still a pretty conservative Islamic society... So Welcome to Qatar..."	1

Hello. I am a British Professional of 4 years experience currently working as a Cost Engineer(construction) in the UK. I have Masters degree in engineering.

Hello; I am thinking of buying a new Suzuki Vitara (around QAR 88k for the full option model); but I have no idea of the resale value of Suzuki&#39;s in Qatar. Can anyone help? Is this a good deal? I was also considering a Rav4; but not sure it&#39;s worth the extra money?

I was also considering a Rav4; but not sure it&#39;s worth the extra money? Thanks	I bought a grand vitara last year XL7 it was for a good price. but i really regretted; the service of teyseer is the worst I've ever experienced: lousy; unhelpful service staff with disgusting facilities. I took me two visits to the service center before i give up and started taking it to other oil changing shops . besides; the car has many manufacturing defects (according to a friend he is still facing them in his new model): CD player; brake system... At the time when I bought it it was the only car with 7 seaters with a very reasonable price (67000); but finally It would have been better for me if i bought a pajero or a pathfinder. On the top of all that the resale value of the suzuki is not so encouraging.	1

I am wondering if the prices in Doha are higher than in the UK. Can there be good deals on sale like lets say jeans for 60-100 QR? Just want to get an idea. Thanks	Jeans from a regular shop in Villagio costs minimum Qar100.00 plus. Women's blouses range from Qar60.00 and much more. Clothes are expensive here; and the quality is not really that well; unless you buy from a signature shop.	1

I am wondering if the prices in Doha are higher than in the UK. Can there be good deals on sale like lets say jeans for 60-100 QR? Just want to get an idea. Thanks	When the exchange rate was 7 clothes were the same if not cheaper than in the UK. But now the rate has dropped to nearly 5 clothes are definitely more expensive here.	0
I am wondering if the prices in Doha are higher than in the UK. Can there be good deals on sale like lets say jeans for 60-100 QR? Just want to get an idea. Thanks	It depends on the brand. As a general rule most UK brands (such as BHS; Next; M&S; H&M) are priced at an exchange rate of QR7 to £1. As the current rate is closer to QR5 to £1 clothes will be cheaper in the UK. On top of this retailers are discounting heavily in the UK because of the recession. If you look at some French or Spanish brands (Zara) they are cheaper in Doha.	1
I am wondering if the prices in Doha are higher than in the UK. Can there be good deals on sale like lets say jeans for 60-100 QR? Just want to get an idea. Thanks	I agree that now the exchange rate is so low then clothes are deifnitely cheaper back in UK especially with the great sales that are on there at the moment. Unless you buy from a recognised brand here the quality is not very good; so my is advice take a holiday back in uk and fill your suitcase with all the bargains there!!	0

I joined a company in Qatar 7 months back. I really wish to quit my job as I am getting better job offers in other firms. My contract is for 2 yrs. So it is evident that they will not give me NOC and i will be banned for 2 yrs. My husband is working here in Qatar. But his salary is too low to apply for a family resident visa. I wish to know if I resign my job and once the company cancels my RP; can I come back to Qatar in family visit visa and extend it for another 5 months. So we hope by the time; we can make any arrangements for family resident visa. Please your reply is really valuable.	0

Go to immigration or submit the following through your company PRO to immigration. NOC letter from your sponsor. Salary Pay Slip RP( The profession must not be labour) your wife and daughter passport Marriage certificate( attested by your embassy) You pay 200riya with this document.(you pay this with your card when you want submit) The visa will be one month visit visa but it can be extended to 6months with payment of 200riya every month provided your wife and child pass the medical test within the first month. Note- TO CHANGE YOUR FAMILY VISIT VISA TO FAMILY RESIDENCE VISA YOU MUST HAVE A SALARY OF 10;000 RIYA. best of luck.	1

Fuwairit beach is about an hour north of Qatar; but can be a little busy if you go at the wrong time. There are a few nice little beaches; almost completely deserted; on the Ras Abrouq peninsula; north of Dukhan; about 90 mins out of Doha.	1

I have left behind a hand made furniture company which once my son is at school I will look to produce here as it does seem we could do with some good furniture here. Many thanks to all your replies and yes I am a lucky man for being in this position and am certainly looking forward to it; I will post a new thread shortly to try and set up a dads group.	0

Hi all I am moving to Doha in January 2013 and will be looking after my son full time whilst my wife will be working. Was wondering if there is any men in a similar situation and any groups or such about? Many thanks	My husband is a stay at home dad too. I tried to get with QL to create a group for stay at home dads. Didnt happen. The same as the stay at home mom's; dad's seem some life outside of watching the kids or even just staying with the kids. PM me and I'll send you my hubby's #. I'm sure he'd be very happy to get together and chat. One thing I can say is kudos to the dad's; you guys do soooo much to take care of our families and sometimes we mom's get lost in our own worlds to realize it. Welcome to Qatar and send me a message and I'll get you his contact --- email/phone; whatever	1

Has anyone actually gone to a doctor here for sleeping pills and recieved them? And if so; are they what we (we as in westerners) would call perscribtion sleeping pills?	There is a sleep clinic at the Hamad. It was there that I discovered that I had sleep apoenea; and they have treated that now. Its abslutely amazing to sleep all night every night; {except when I forget and have caffeine; or a fizzy drink by mistake) - first time in over 40 years! Go to the second floor (the one above ground floor)in the OutPatient Dept and ask at room 215 for the sleep clinic. They will direct you as to what you have to do to be assessed. You will need a Hamad Health Card (100 QR) for this. Angelwings.	1
Has anyone actually gone to a doctor here for sleeping pills and recieved them? And if so; are they what we (we as in westerners) would call perscribtion sleeping pills?	Thanks for the info. What did they do in order to dignose you? And how long did it take? And do you know if you can get sleeping pills? Great that you are able to sleep all night. I have not done that since moving to Qatar. My sleeping patterns are up and down; more down :(	0
Has anyone actually gone to a doctor here for sleeping pills and recieved them? And if so; are they what we (we as in westerners) would call perscribtion sleeping pills?	I had to stay overnight at the Hamad Hosp; while a couple monitored me all night from another room. I was wired up all over the place; which for me wasn't too comfortable; and then left to 'sleep'... which I did very little of anyway as I didn't like the 'wiring'. I was also diagnosed by the Maxillo Facial Surgeon; who checked the size of my jaw; tongue etc etc; and noted that this was one of the causes of my apnoea. I didn't do the 'sleeping pills run' as I had an operation instead to alter my jaw and remove a bit of my tongue (sounds gross; but wasn't really that bad). But this is definitely the route to take; as pills may not be the answer for you... maybe there is something else wrong that can be corrected. Hope you get 'relief' soon...I know what you're going thru! Angelwings	0
Has anyone actually gone to a doctor here for sleeping pills and recieved them? And if so; are they what we (we as in westerners) would call perscribtion sleeping pills?	I really don't think they would find anything wrong with me though. I've had the same problem sleeping for years. Sometimes I have no problems sleeping; depends what is happening in my life...Stress being the main factor! So; having the odd sleeping pill to take would be great. I knew I should of made that trip to the Doctor before leaving Canada; lol. Thanks!	0
Has anyone actually gone to a doctor here for sleeping pills and recieved them? And if so; are they what we (we as in westerners) would call perscribtion sleeping pills?	Dear Charlene; i have the same problem; for about 10 years. I saw a doctor here in Hamad Outpatients; his name is Abdoul Moneim; he is a very good psichiatrist; and he prescibed me the same sleeping pills i use to take in my country; that's Zolpidem (or Stillnox); its relly good; but he will not give you more than 14 tablets. When i canot get this medicine; i use to take Tryptozol 25 mg; but only half tablet; you can find it in any farmacy without prescription. I wish you good luck and sleep well..	1
Has anyone actually gone to a doctor here for sleeping pills and recieved them? And if so; are they what we (we as in westerners) would call perscribtion sleeping pills?	Panadol night but I think u know it. Or sleep assured tablets sold at pharmaceuticals which is good because its components is from natural extracts. Theres a do-it-urself remedy that works like a charm too and that would be lettuce juice; have it b4 u go 2 bed. I know it sounds nasty and it doesnt taste any better but ull definitely find it effective.	0
Has anyone actually gone to a doctor here for sleeping pills and recieved them? And if so; are they what we (we as in westerners) would call perscribtion sleeping pills?	I'm an insomniac and rarely sleep before 3 a.m.. I once tried an over-the-counter herbal concoction called Sleep-Aid. While it made me drowsy it didn't knock me out and I had a terrific hangover the next day. Saw it the other day at the pharmacy. Terrible not being able to sleep.	0
Has anyone actually gone to a doctor here for sleeping pills and recieved them? And if so; are they what we (we as in westerners) would call perscribtion sleeping pills?	Hi Julia; Thanks for your reply. It is so good to hear that there is help out there! I guess I should of just went and asked a Dr. here instead of assuming that it would be like it was in Kuwait and couldn't get anything stronger then a Advil! Hope you are getting good rest now... bajesus; I'm afraid Panaodol night would never do the trick for me. As for the luttuce juice; well; I would rather stay awake! lol. Thanks though! e46m3 I can relate for sure. Nothing worse then trying to sleep and then just laying there tossing and turning. I've learned to just get up and stay up untill I feel like I'm going to drop; lol. A lot of nights I get out of bed and stay up the whole night without any sleep! Go to bed anywhere from 5:00 to 8:00 A.M and still only get a few hours sleep...Person can't function well to say to least. I've been up for two hours this morning and it is now only 6:00! And it is moving day..... Hope to hear you are getting some much needed rest! Thanks everyone; Charlene	0
Has anyone actually gone to a doctor here for sleeping pills and recieved them? And if so; are they what we (we as in westerners) would call perscribtion sleeping pills?	Have you made sure that you're cutting out all caffeine before sleeping? It takes 6 hours to flush out caffeine from the body; which is found in not only the obvious; like tea and coffee; but also in fizzy drinks like coke; seven-up etc; tonic water (very; very bad!!); soda water; beer; and sparkling wines and sparkling mineral water. Anything with bubbles can activate the brain instead of allowing it to sleep. Also; chocolate is a sleep depriver too. If you're taking any of the above within six hours of going to bed; then you'll have sleep problems if you react to them. Most folk don't think about the chocolate biscuit with a cuppa; late on in the day; but that's saying goodbye to sleep! regardless of what stress you are or aren't under. I stayed awake for four days once; when I was drinking just tonic water (I don't have a sweet tooth). A friend told me of his similar situation when he'd had a tonic water in a 'mixer' drink. He also took four days to figure out what was wrong...and e.....	0

I would like to get some opinion about online job recruitment sites like bayt ;gulftalent etc.. Do they really consider the CV's send ? Has anybody got jobs via these online sites ?	Hi; I posted a forum topic on same last week; it seems that the answer is no; I have never heard back from any of them.	1
I would like to get some opinion about online job recruitment sites like bayt ;gulftalent etc.. Do they really consider the CV's send ? Has anybody got jobs via these online sites ?	these sites definitely reflect the lack of understanding of recruitment in people who designed them what they do is to match you on very limited criteria such as the last industry you worked in. What I mean is: if for example you've worked in Oil & Gas for years; but your last job (even just 6 momths) was in pharmaceuticals; then they will match you with pharmaceuticals! Working in HR I look on CVs posted on Gulf Talent only in desperate times and to be honest never employed anyone through these web sites. So; if you're looking for a job; I would suggest uploading your CV on Gult Talent or Bayt just in case you get lucky; but spend most of your efforts applying directly through companies' web sites and going in to the companies to hand in your CV. Good luck!	1
I would like to get some opinion about online job recruitment sites like bayt ;gulftalent etc.. Do they really consider the CV's send ? Has anybody got jobs via these online sites ?	hi; even the same with me .. i applied for many post in gulf talent and bayt and in return i got a mail from gulf talent saying that the post is closed ... its always the same.. got bored to fill the application almost from past 7 months am applying for these .. no reply from them.. got vexed up... its better to try in some other way .. rather than wasting time in filling up those applications ...	1
I would like to get some opinion about online job recruitment sites like bayt ;gulftalent etc.. Do they really consider the CV's send ? Has anybody got jobs via these online sites ?	The look for key words to match afainst a given criteria. They have no means of assessing an individual or his/her real skills.	1
I would like to get some opinion about online job recruitment sites like bayt ;gulftalent etc.. Do they really consider the CV's send ? Has anybody got jobs via these online sites ?	They don't read the CV at all. Three times in last one month; they have shortlisted me for a job in the company I work in presently; lol..	1

Brit and WK - firstly... good morning... long time no see :o) secondly.... the sites are desinged by sales people; not qualified recruiters.

I promise you... interesting! :o)	1

How good are Karwa services? Are they: 1. Courteous/Rude? 2. Taking the correct route/Longer route? 3. Have they asked you ""do you want to go by the meter""? 4. Using the GPS? 6. In knowledge of the route? 7. A pleasure/displeasure to ride?"	for me; they are 10/10; why; I used their services ONLY for airport pick & drop; wallahi; can be booked over phone; they're always ONTIME; reasonably courteous; correct route-well; there's noway he can take a detour; pleasure : i dont expect 'pleasure' from 'em.	1

I use them a lot for a variety of uses as I live in Dukhan. 5 years ago if you called and asked for a taxi tomorrow they would say that nothing was available until 3am two weeks on Tuesday. Now they say yes no problem; call back to confirm the details; call the day before to remind me and call when he is on the way. I have never had a problem with the drivers except sometimes they are clearly under a lot of pressure and stressed. Maybe people could show some compassion for the drivers who live under difficult conditions so you get a cheap service. By the way I find the blatant racism on this website offensive. Most forums would not allow it. It is outrageous to define people by their nationality and such serious allegations; if not able to prove are simply slanderous.	1

However; had bad experience with an $$$$$$$$ (as told by the driver himself...tried to run away with my bag) and an ************ (asked for more than the amount on meter as tip to provide better living for his 7-8 kids back home. I only asked him why so many if you cant afford. I walked out without being asked the second time). 2) They know the route; never had to direct them but some did try to use the long route only to be denied by me. 3) NA 4) Dont know. 5) Not in the list ...:) 6)Refer 2. 7) Just OK...for 10-15 minutes I am not looking for former.	1

Everything is the opposite now; no meters; they think you are foreign with loads of money. They chat too much in the car and ask questions which is none of their business. They decide where they want to go; NOT where you want to go; if it doesn't suit them; they shake their head and drive off!! If only there was another taxi company; then Karwa will start to pull up their socks!	0

I just stumbled across this news article about the the American university campuses at Education City and thought some of you may also find it interesting.	the author of that article seemed to have no clue as to the country's appeal. First of all; he made it seem as the only arabic people interested in studying were Qataris and Egyptians (when 20% of the arab students here are from Kuwait; UAE and Saudi). He also tried to lightly mention a bit of disappointment about the fact that the 'mingling' period had no alcohol... (odd to mention it since I've never been to any educational event where there is alcohol in the UK or in Japan) He made it seem as nobody was interested in QU when the university is always full and it's a beautiful university at that. __________________________ Cost of Living; Visas; Safety Info; Tips; Pics; Vids and m	0

I just stumbled across this news article about the the American university campuses at Education City and thought some of you may also find it interesting.	Actually yes. This is an article which says a lot about education and the interest shown in it by the country. As Sydney Brenner (Nobel laureate) says 'No matter how big or small a country is; there can be no better investment than in education'.	1
I just stumbled across this news article about the the American university campuses at Education City and thought some of you may also find it interesting.	"Folks; The term ""Oil Money"" and Petro-Dollars is mis-used. It somehow gives the impression that the money is black or dirty. Oil is a resource. And it is OIL and its related development which has given us folks in the Gulf so many jobs.

I just stumbled across this news article about the the American university campuses at Education City and thought some of you may also find it interesting.	"Tallg; When Booth killed Lincoln; he shouted "" Woe to the Traitors""; similar to what Brutus said when he killed Caesar. The Western media has an inherent bias; which is very subtle. Israeli forces are called: IDF ( Israeli Defense Forces) Whereas; a Palestinian child  throwing a rock at an Israeli tank passing through his family orchard is a ""Future terrorist"" I dont support either the soldier or the rock-thrower. However; I believe in calling a spade a spade. That's why a magazine like ""The Economist"" is respectable and a media source like ""Fox News"" or ""CNN"" is a farce to promote the bias inherent in their owners. The Internet; howvere; has changed all that by breaking the monopoly of content generation and content dissipation. :-) zaki the duckie"	0

I just stumbled across this news article about the the American university campuses at Education City and thought some of you may also find it interesting.	Tallg; I have had remarks like 'what have you cooked'  or stick to poetry; which were completely irrelavant to the topic so don't be disappointed. It is a healthy article for many. I wanted to add few excerpts from Dr. Tidu Maini; who is a adviser to 'Sheikha Mouza'. He says 'developing countries will fail if they do not invest in education and research and convert their economies into knowledge based ones'. So there is a lot of interest being generated into research and knowledge; particularly in energy; environment and healthcare.	0

Nothing but smart allecks Dobashi; ignore and move on as I agree with Toys R'Us having a small choice and ignorant customer service compared to back in Europe and for sure in the US too. They just had a part-sale and must be expecting new stock and as everything is so well coordinated in this country; timings went wrong ;)	1

Hi friends! I wanna know if there is a land route from Doha to Abudhabi. If yes; how is the road and how long is the journey? Thanks in advance. Have a great weekend :)	Its Via Saudi Border..... It takes 6 hrs approx... Njoy ur hourney buddy.	1
Hi friends! I wanna know if there is a land route from Doha to Abudhabi. If yes; how is the road and how long is the journey? Thanks in advance. Have a great weekend :)	There is land route via Saudi Arabia. You have to cross Qatar- Saudi border; then Saudi-UAE border. Both borders u will have to spend atleast one hour for clearance. Then you have to pay road insurance for both the countries(ie. Saudi and UAE). The road in between qatar- saudi border and saudi-UAE border is not that good. Extra care is required. UAE border post; you may have to scan your eye for entry visa purposes that can take sometime. Altogether you have to spend 6 to 7 hours..... enjoy your trip	1

I heard that after 2 years they stop looking for you and you can still visit Dubai without any problems; best would be to contact your bank and tell them the situation before they report you to the authorities...since you have intentions of paying them back.	0

Hello; My employer got me a business visa and not a working visa. They said that it's hard to get a work visa so they will just fix my work visa when I get there. Does this really happen? They also said they'll book me a return ticket; but I failed to ask why. I worry that they could just throw me elsewhere when they become unhappy with my work performance...Hoping someone could enlighten me on this; thanks.	It takes time to apply for a work visa. Another thing it will take also some time to process your papers there in P.I. They booked you a return ticket because you will not be allowed by P.I. immigration to board with only one way ticket. You're on a business visa and you need to come back to where you came from. That is only for formality sake so you can passed thru Immigration. Better have your medical check up there before coming here. Like chest x-ray and blood stool urine lab test. If you fail here you will be sent back.	1

Takes time to get the work visa. ""... they could just throw me elsewhere when they become unhappy with my work performance..."" When you have your work visa later; you'll need an exit permit from your sponsor / employer every time you go out at the airport; so it is suggested that you do keep them happy with your work performance ... of course; you will; I'm just saying."	1

Another friend of mine mentioned that some employers who are unhappy with the performance of their employees use that business visa as an excuse in terminating the unperforming employee. The employer will exit the employee to a nearby country; saying that they will just fix the work visa but in reality; they will already terminate the employee.	0

The problem arises in the Immigration in Philippines. They will ask lots of questions and squeeze in some out of nowhere questions.. Just be prepared and act one that knows the Law.If you fail to pass thru the immigration; they will definitely get the last penny you have in you pocket. I felt bad to some people who are a victim of this. There was already a report in yahoo maktob stating how cruel the immigration officers in asking for some money for the individual to get out of the country! Aren't they supposed to let that person pass peacefully? I hate to say this but ; my tax when I was still working in Manila;paid them well enough... so they should serve us well and with respect instead of bullying us for the sake of money! :D Just my 2 cents here!	1

At least if this is a common practice; i can put my mind at ease. And that thing about the immigration sounded new to me; thanks for warning me.

There is a heavy abuse of the Business visa concept. Filipinos find their ways to buy this type of visa for the purpose of coming to Qatar and searching a job here. Which is illegal. Your immigration fellows only use your own criminal approach to this matter. One part of the mafia is buying the illegal visas. Another part of the mafia wants to have their fat piece out of it. Simple. YOUR own criminal action leads to your immigration officers’ criminal actions. YOU ALL are involved in this vicious circle; as one criminal group. STOP buying the illegal visas; and this will cut the ground from under the feets of your fellow-immigration officers; and they will stop demanding thier share. Sunny ; as an exception; it does not apply to you. Unlike others; you got your business visa legally; issued by your hiring Company. Other hundreds and hundreds of your fellow filipinos abuse this law. And then they complain that other law abusers want to .....	0

Thank you for your information and appreciate that you had said that to me. I got your point.Why should we blame a person who wanted to work for their family? Lucky you; you came from a good country :)I wonder why your are here in qatar? :D But still people who bought the visa are part of the crime.

We have to pay for our own accomadation till I go perm thanks Matt	Matt; I've been here pretty much since 2008; and overall the place has improved since then. Certain laws and regulations change; and it can be a frustrating place; but on the whole you can live a very nice life here. I moved from London; and adjusted pretty easily. Come with an open mind and you'll be fine. There are plenty of people in the same position and you'll meet other expats easily. What I will say; is you have to build your life here and it can be an easy place to hate if you don't make the effort....especially for the wife. Hopefully she's outgoing; and it shouldn't be a problem to meet people. Choosing where to live is a big part! Maersk is in West Bay so possibly get an amazing apartment here close to all the bars and restaurants and City Center for shopping. Better for the wife if she can walk to places....Get somewhere short term in West Bay to start and give yourself a chance to learn about Doha and where you want to be permanently located. Longer message than planned!! .....	1

Hi Can anyone tell me what the procedure is when first coming over to Qatar; are you given a little time to sort out your home and transport before attending work and when do companies tend to give you your furniture allowance. How do workers from blighty generally get paid into UK or Qatar banks? Who are the best internet and satalite providers? Whats the weather like!!! lol	depend who you working for. I am sure every company have their own way doing things. For us ... we were given a company housing for the first 3 months ; then they give you allowance to look somewhere else. We receive our furniture allowance as soon as my husband pass his probation period. The first 2 weeks husband get a car and a driver to go to work; after that we rent a car till we received our resident permit and able to buy a car. Internet so far only 1 provider : Qtel.So take it or leave it... you dont have a choice. The pay tranferred to our local bank; then every few months we send the money to the UK. Anyway ... welcome to QL; do use the 'search' button on the top right to search any question you have in mind. Anything you want to ask in perticular just post away :-) The weather at the moment when you go outdoor just like you go inside the sauna room ...	1

What is best mall in Doha to buy good furniture? Where are best furniture stores and showrooms. Thank you :)	Totally depends on your budget! Salwa Road (You can find some luxury designer brands and bathroom/kitchen fittings.) Home Center in City Center; Centerpoint/Al Asmakh Mall; and Musheireb. Homes R Us in Hyatt Plaza. Bo Concept in City Center. Souq Al Haraj in Najma area. ID Design in The Mall. Origins (www . originssofas . com) I usually end up buying from Home Center because it's relatively inexpensive; and at times I take things apart and customize them. Some of the couches in ID Design are very cute; colorful; modern and at a decent price if you are looking for something nicer than Home Center. But Doha still lacks a great basics store for furniture. That's why everyone is waiting on Ikea.	1

Other than Home Center; what are the other furniture stores in Doha that have quality furniture with reasonable prices?	Try ID Design at The Mall. Another personal favorite is Global Art at Salwa road just before Midmac roundabout. There is also The One at the Landmark. Their collection isn't as good as it used to be though.	1

Look at Bombay Company in the Mall and their US website and compare the prices. We wanted a bed that cost 17;000 riyals in their shop here and on the US website $1000; exact same bed. The silly (Lebanese) manager at the Mall shop said no discount; only for repeat customers! They wanted to maintain exclusivity. I think he meant the exclusivity of fleecing gullible customers or the exclusion of reason. One of the two. Even if I were to ship it from the US it would be cheaper buying it from the website.	0

My wife was recently quoted QR4k by a shop on Salwa Rd to do one (ONE!) window!As we've got about ten to do; I'd really rather not have that sort of outlay. I'd like to get 'proper' ones; with hooks at the top and a pulley on the side; but so far all we've seen is guys who want to prey on expats or that service Qataris; to whom money is no object.

Go to Share Asmakh; either from A ring road or Arab round about; in front of Qatar National Hotel; there are two to three shops who sell curtain cloth; a meter length range from Qr18 to Qr 120 for a width of 140 CMS. You choose the cloth and they stich for you any design for a cost. Souk haraj has cheap ones hardly last two wash. Happy decoration when you throw party dont forget me.	1
My wife was recently quoted QR4k by a shop on Salwa Rd to do one (ONE!) window!As we've got about ten to do; I'd really rather not have that sort of outlay. I'd like to get 'proper' ones; with hooks at the top and a pulley on the side; but so far all we've seen is guys who want to prey on expats or that service Qataris; to whom money is no object. Would really appreciate it if anyone could point us in the right direction.	There are a number of curtain places down on Salwa road. If you have tried them all; then try the road that goes by the airport. Look up a place called Sedar. Call 180 and you will get their number. And one more thing; money is an object with us Qataris. Not every single one of us is a billionaire; more of us work to make money!	1

We now have excellent cutains; simple pleated ones with pulleys and sheers. The choice of material suited us as well (York textiles) and best of all the price was between Qr800- Qr850 (depending upon the window size). Good craftmanship; too. All the best.	1

Does anyone know of a good mattress shop in Doha?	Yes King Koil is a good one otherwise there Matnaflex which is Qatari made & cheaper or Springwall All these shops are located on Salwa road. King Koil & matnaflex are nearly next to each other on the rightside coming from Midmac.

Does anyone know of a good mattress shop in Doha?	Get it ordered from IKEA UAE; go to the web site www.IKEAUAE.com; they have the best matresses (Sultana). there isn't an online ordering link but i think you can have ARMEX or TNT courier companies that can pick up the item and deliver it to you here in doha; the price of the best matress is around QR 1600. King Koil is around 2600 to 5000.	1
Does anyone know of a good mattress shop in Doha?	Thank you!!	0
Does anyone know of a good mattress shop in Doha?	I will go and recommend King Koil. It's my father's place. Without sounding biased; you will ALWAYS get great deals and when my father says you get a guarantee; you get a guarantee 100% no questions asked. King Koil is one of the best mattresses around. Tell you what though; say that Khalifa Saleh recommended you (Saleh Haroon's son) and you might even get an extra discount! ^_^ As for Ikea; I have bought two mattresses from them in the past; I've had them go wonky or unshaped within 6 months and Ikea refused to even talk to me. __________________________ I Love Qatar - http://www.iloveqatar.net	1

That is the question! Is it worth bringing furniture to Doha? I'd be looking for apartments when I get there - how are the fully furnished places? Furniture ok? Or is it wiser to look for a semi-furnished place and bring my stuff? Thanks S	Hi there! Personally I would not bring furniture when it comes to a fully furnished apartment in Doha ; as they do have the basic stuff being put in already;such as tv; tv cabinet; wardrobe; sofa bed . Like me; I will be very soon moving to one of the fully furnished apartment as well; n now have the difficulties getting rid of my bed; sofa; tv n cabinets - omg it sure will gonna take some time y'know; so judging from my own experience; I would not recommend you to bring too many of your own furniture :) Oh and welcome to Doha! :)	1
That is the question! Is it worth bringing furniture to Doha? I'd be looking for apartments when I get there - how are the fully furnished places? Furniture ok?

That is the question! Is it worth bringing furniture to Doha? I'd be looking for apartments when I get there - how are the fully furnished places? Furniture ok? Or is it wiser to look for a semi-furnished place and bring my stuff? Thanks S	Yes there is and it tends to be cheaper if u choose this option; but then again it also means they might not provide too many furnitures to you. I think it varies too when it comes to different property companies providing just what sort of furnitures; so it's important to find out from each of them if you do wanna go for a semi furnished one :)	1
That is the question! Is it worth bringing furniture to Doha? I'd be looking for apartments when I get there - how are the fully furnished places? Furniture ok? Or is it wiser to look for a semi-furnished place and bring my stuff? Thanks S	semi-furnished generally doeasn't mean what it does elsewhere. Here I believe it means curtains; stove; oven; dishwaher and washing machine.	0

That is the question! Is it worth bringing furniture to Doha? I'd be looking for apartments when I get there - how are the fully furnished places? Furniture ok? Or is it wiser to look for a semi-furnished place and bring my stuff? Thanks S	At this point you only have a temporary contract. You must past the medical exam which takes about a month to get your results. Meanwhile; you won't be issued a Qatar ID until you get your medical results and sign your permanent contract. Without a Qatar ID you won't be able to rent an apartment. Majority of the buildings have electrical and plumbing problems due to the unskilled foreign laborer's. Therefore; rent a fully furnished all-inclusive or company housing till you feel you might stay over a year.	1

Or is it wiser to look for a semi-furnished place and bring my stuff? Thanks S	Hmm... slightly rude; but ok. Like I said (and meant) I worked offshore mostly and was in the office for a few days at a time for 7 months 2 years ago - so never had to deal with housing before. I'm going to be stationed there permanently now; gene the reason for finding an apartment; buying furniture etc.	0
That is the question! Is it worth bringing furniture to Doha? I'd be looking for apartments when I get there - how are the fully furnished places? Furniture ok? Or is it wiser to look for a semi-furnished place and bring my stuff? Thanks S	I agree. Do not bring your furniture because most apartments around Doha are fully furnish.I notice the difference between fully & semi is only 2k Qatari Riyals. I made a mistake bring my own furniture as I was recommended to bring.But the shipment container was paid for so I don't mind. So now i just mix my one set furniture which consist of 3 seater; 2 seater & one seater;carpet & one table with the apartment's furniture. Furniture at home centre are not that expensive IMO. if you do find a apartment or villa semi furnished.	1

Chances are good he himself might be an owner of a pickup. If not he would definitely arrange one for you. Or if you could drive down to Alfardan bus stand; you can find such big pickups parked in line with pathans sitting in the driving seats. The rate will obviously depend on from where you have to pickup your furniture and where to drop; but it should be within or around QR100. Bargaining will possibly bring down what you end up paying. One word of caution! Used furnitures are the primary source of blood sucker bed bugs.	1

Most decent towers will have a pool as well as possibly a tennis court. Or you could join one of the nearby hotel clubs. The villa compound life is more suited towards families.

Thank you for your feedback	1)No more aladdin kingdom...but it was one of the best places; even better than aqua park. similar to that there is none so far. if you like you can try doha toy tow 2) Yes open. similar place for water excitement in doha; None 3) Not open. But under renovation for next 5 years. similar one is al dosari farm. but not as good as doha zoo. doha zoo was any way boring because half of the time the animals will be sleeping.	1

I haven't been but I think in Doha; where you are always being watched; this was a bad idea. How can you relax when you are under scrutiny? It's hardly a fun; carefree environment is it.

I know what you are saying about dirty looks and I too am always in jeans and t-shirts. I get embarressed though when I see women in revealing or too tight tops...

The thread that was here yesterday has been removed without trace for some reason. Is it in light of today's events?	I think the QDC thread had gone before the reports of the Villagio Mall fire - - - if that is what you are referring to as 'today's events' Mods - is it possible to remove or edit any offensive posts rather than blitzing the complete thread? The first few posts in the QDC thread that has now gone were pretty innocuous. Maybe it got naughty later ... ???

The thread that was here yesterday has been removed without trace for some reason. Is it in light of today's events?	I accept your source that there has been a fire there. At some point. But when did it happen and was it the original cause of the sudden closure? The shop doors were fine; clean and there were no signs of smoke (at least near the entrance) and some lights inside were still working when I went there on about 4th April. Couple of days after it shut. I'll have a look next time I pass that way.	0

My understanding was the same as Gypsy's - when transporting liquor it should be in the trunk/boot or covered up; i.e. not in view of anyone passing the vehicle. I was told this by other people; but have not heard it officially. -------------------------------------------- http://tall-and-ginger.blogspot.com	0

Could this be a problem?	i agree with tallg and gypsy; even though you have a liqour permit you need to be discrete when transporting booze to your place; if you're a little bit observant there is a notice at QDC stating that transporting ligouqrs; specifically on those cartons; should be placed inside the trunk of their car; and should not be exposed.	1

Above is correct QDC is the only alcohol store in Qatar and you will be about 10 mins max from it. The compound is great; its quiet loads of kids about if you have kids good for them. It also has a shop very handy. And i think they have started doing shisha and coffee in the clubhouse. Plus loads of nice people inc many of my collegues; your lucky to get it.	1

How much is deemed acceptable to tip a taxi driver? I was told by a couple of people who ave lived here for years that you dont tip them but i feel that as they are really helpful with assisting me and my kids in and out of the taxi; they deserve a tip. Also what do people do when a taxi driver doesnt turn on the meter on a very short trip and at the end of the trip; says pay as you wish? How am i to know what to pay him if i havent taken that route before? Any advice?	give them 3 or 5 riyals extra will make them over the moon nadt. Last night our taxi from the airport started from 18 QR; since our house just next door to the airport the meter only reach to 25 QR. My husband give 35QR because the driver was so helpfull helping us out with the cases.	1

How am i to know what to pay him if i havent taken that route before? Any advice?	My criteria in tipping the taxi driver are: 1- Don't ask me no questions about me or don't tell me where you from. I got my Confession Booth for those moments. 2- Don't drive like you are driving Miss Daisy or some Indianapolis 500 racing stock car in the roads. Better use those turn signals and do your yielding. I have enough of the local population egocentric driving habits. 3- Don't be smelling like Garlic or some lost flowering fragrance; it just gives me a headache. I Don't want memories of the local malls. 4- Better have the meter on and pronounce those numbers properly. 5- and learn to difference between; drive Straight ahead; turn left and turn right. Then I might tip you... With a Thank you! The Red Pope of Qatar Living	0

How am i to know what to pay him if i havent taken that route before? Any advice?	Tip if the driving is good and don't if it isn't. Please do NOT reward bad driving. Please ask your driver to pull over SAFELY and not stop in the middle of the road. RP - loved your post. add: don't assume the passenger wants to listen to your crappy music on a radio that isn't even tuned in. I was once in a fragrant smelling taxi with Vivaldi playing...wonderful..and yes big tip.	0

Hi probably this topic have been discusse but i want to know how much someone can give for a tips. An example is you pay 200 QAR  for a dinner a 10 QAR for a tip is good?

Hi probably this topic have been discusse but i want to know how much someone can give for a tips. An example is you pay 200 QAR  for a dinner a 10 QAR for a tip is good?	i normally leave tips about QR 5; but then again i was on my own. Like when i am having breakfast on my own in one of the cafe in villagio ... my bill come to like QR 40 to QR 50 ; i left QR 5 as a tip. IMO it is a fair amount.	1

Hi probably this topic have been discusse but i want to know how much someone can give for a tips. An example is you pay 200 QAR  for a dinner a 10 QAR for a tip is good?	daiwai ... if you spent QR 50; 10 percents would be only QR 5. But when you eat in the hotel ... you will easily spent QR 600 to QR 700 ; on top of that they will charge you another 17 percents ... and you still have to leave 10 percents for the tip? but then again if you can afford to pay the bill ... surely you can afford to leave some $$$ for tipping ???  	1
Hi probably this topic have been discusse but i want to know how much someone can give for a tips. An example is you pay 200 QAR  for a dinner a 10 QAR for a tip is good?	Then I don t add any more; even though I suspect the waiting staff may bot get the tip. In the Us they expact 20%cnow. The Ritz Carlton no longer add service; an d the staff get the tip - at least in the Italien restaurant.......I belive the 17% is a combo of service and tax...  If you're living life on the edge; you've got too much room.	0
Hi probably this topic have been discusse but i want to know how much someone can give for a tips. An example is you pay 200 QAR  for a dinner a 10 QAR for a tip is good?	if theres service charge don't leave any; probably won't be lining the waiters pockets anyway!	1
Hi probably this topic have been discusse but i want to know how much someone can give for a tips. An example is you pay 200 QAR  for a dinner a 10 QAR for a tip is good?	when there is service charge.. dont tip coz its included.. and when the waiter is bad.. again dont tip... lol.. else 5-10% depending on bill value..	1
Hi probably this topic have been discusse but i want to know how much someone can give for a tips. An example is you pay 200 QAR  for a dinner a 10 QAR for a tip is good?	I think it's very rare for the service charge included in the bill to go to the waiters. I don't even know if 'service' actual means the waiter service. Best to ask the waiter if they get it or not. If they don't then leave a tip if you think they deserve it; for the amount you think they deserve. I hate the American culture of always tipping. A normal tip should reward normal service; with a bigger tip rewarding service above your expectations. But if the service is poor (as it so often is here) then they haven't earnt a tip in my opinion.	1
Hi probably this topic have been discusse but i want to know how much someone can give for a tips.

Hi; I want ask to all of bartenders or waiters/waitresess about what is your experiences with tipping in doha (in luxury restaurant).I will come here in february and work as a bartender in tornado tower;and i want just know what can i expect from peoples or from tipping here. (If my earn will be above 100QR per month on tips? ) Share your experiences please :) Matus	Please note that for every 10 person you will serve on the bar there are only 2 possible person that can give you a tip personally. Here in Qatar tips are not usually considered unless by the white peoples. But you need also to consider the company policy on tipping; for there are some which is centralized. But if you're expecting to received 100 riyals tip per day; I can say there's a big possibilities that you might not get it; besides; for sure you're not just the only one who's working there as a waiter.	1

Yipeeeee; I finally got my visa to come to Doha!! Should I bring some cash with me for when I first arrive in Doha or will it be easy enough to use my cash card?

(Famous last words!) I will finally be arriving in Doha on Saturday morning. What about tipping in Doha?? Is it usual practice to tip taxi drivers in Doha? What about tipping in general; who to tip and how much? This is my first time in Doha and the Middle East so don't want to make any mistakes or offend/upset people. Thanks again for any advice.	0

I believe your company men will arrive at the airport to pick you up. call Taxis are identified as ""KARWA"" in here. There's no regular practice in tipping for taxis in doha Qr.2+ will do; however if you dont prefer there's no harm. People who deserve tips 1. Runners(who serve you parcels while you are on car) for small restaurants. 2. Petrol fillers. 3. Private car cleaners 4. The lists are endless; you will identify once you arrive in here... 5. road side guys selling news papers on hot weather. best of luck."	0

Are there cash matchines at the airport and in the hotels? Thanks for any advice.	You can most certainly use your cash card; providing it's hooked up to a world ATM network (Cirrus; etc.) or has a credit card symbol. I was not charged a fee by QNB (Qatar National Bank); only by my home bank (which I fully expected). As for an ATM in arrivals; unfortunately; I've not seen one. I may have missed it; though; as I've been wisked through by the greeting service both times. If you are going to a hotel first; you can either use an ATM or take cash and exchange it. I did this (exchanged cash) the first time at the Intercon(tinental) without difficulty. Just ask when you check in. If you are going to your accommodation; malls and shops are open late now with it being Ramandan (1 am or so). Ask your driver for advice. City Center Doha (the big mall); which I live across from; is like this. 10 minutes and the money problem is solved. Established shops will take a credit card should you need to make a purchase before you can get to the ATM. However; Doha is pretty wired. You ca.....	1

Are there cash matchines at the airport and in the hotels? Thanks for any advice.	Thanks for your comments and advice. The company have arranged limo to collect me and my son from the airport and to take us to the hotel. I was not sure if I would need to tip the driver or not. I think that I will just use my card to withdraw cash from my UK bank account when I first get to Doha so that I have some cash to use for small purchases and I will pay for larger purchases with my card. Thanks again for your help.	0
Yipeeeee; I finally got my visa to come to Doha!! Should I bring some cash with me for when I first arrive in Doha or will it be easy enough to use my cash card? Are there cash matchines at the airport and in the hotels? Thanks for any advice.	Mmm... well; I can see your point there. However; as you're just arriving in the country; no one is expecting you to have riyals ready to distribute. Or I'd hope not. Besides; the ATM spits out bigger bills than you'd tip to a driver (as in every country; UK included). So then you'd have the trouble of having to get one broken down. If you're going to the hotel; and you really want to tip the driver; just ask him to wait for a second. Run in; tell them what you want to do; and change a bill. Or borrow 10 riyals from the bellhop; tell them you're changing money in just a second; and then give it back after you've changed money. Truthfully; though; I wouldn't sweat it too much. You'll have other things to occupy yourself with. Which hotel? The Intercon is quite nice. The breakfast buffet is gigantic. Literally 15 kinds of bread (at least). Fresh fruit juices. A whole long table filled with fruit and cheeses.	1

Dead serious; in the two times I've flown through I've not seen it. I don't mean to sound like an idiot (although I inevitably have... ha!); and I totally believe you; as I also thought it a bit odd that there was no cashpoint; but I haven't managed to see it.	0

I've been met by Al Maha both times and whisked away from baggage to where a driver was waiting for me. Then I've gone straight out of the airport; to the car. I was thinking of the arrivals area BEFORE you go through the x-ray for appearances' sake process; as that's what I've seen. Cheers for confirming that I haven't gone completely nutter; just haven't seen the public area of arrivals yet. (^^)."	0

I see this man every morning; cleaning the road. I want to give him some money…(not any big amount)but I feel odd to offer money to a person who is not asking for it.

If I see him tomorrow; What to do?	there is saying it's better to give than to receive; you are willing to give though not that big amount but when it came from you heart; you fell like you win the whole world; what a good heart and a good samaritan of you; don't think twice; give it to him if you know he deserves to receive the money. And in return god will give more than what you gave to somebody. We in fact; if not of them cleaning the road or our environment here in qatar; maybe qatar is a big mess. So to those working off the road; i am proud of them for doing there job. Small or big amount can make them happy because they know someone's thinking of them including you gypsy. god bless you	1

I am confused; I kept the money handy in the car.... because of the traffic the car moves very slowly in that area; I can give it to him easily…..but am not able to do it for the past 4 days; and I feel so bad about it. If I see him tomorrow; What to do?	The problem is I always follow my head and not my heart; but I wonder why this time I am not able to ignore my heart....lol	0

But a little disappointed in you; about this thread; didn't expect you to be such a show off! Hehehe. Nopes; haven't got the tickets for the show yet. I wonder if such exhorbitant prices are worth it? For Qrs. 150; I think they're giving you seats in 2nd gallery. Might be a good idea to take binoculars along. ----------------------------------------- 2100 QL Points!!! Yay! Way to go Ray! ----------------------------------------- www.e4u.name.qa	0
Almost everybody here for sure goes to Lulu Hypermarket for groceries. It is very annoying for these cashiers to pay your change with CANDIES. I think Lulu Hypermarket has to stop this method of paying customer their changes. It's like paying them extra for nothing. Are we sure those candies are for sale or excess to their stocks? Isn't it 50;75 dirhams or even 1 riyal is worth saving? Don't you think so?	try to pay them back with those candies and see what they say lol ...	0

Its very annoying; as the CANDIES become Qatar currency; if they don’t have change they should not price there products with dirham’s; we should all reject this practice; I always do.	1
Is Qatar out of Coins? I have noticed that many businesses here in Qatar instead of giving the proper change back on a purchase; they try to give a candy or some gum. And the prices are always conveniently priced at a little over .50. The clerk always says sorry Sr. We have no change or the boss tells us to give the gum. It’s a great way for them to earn extra. When they offer me the gum I tell them I will use my ATM card	Quite funny that it is always the paying customer who is on the losing end. Why not offer one customer the chewing gum and the next one the 1 Riyal? I carry a little wallet full of coins with me - because I do NOT want any of that crappy chewy or minty candy they want to give me.	0

You have to ask them 'how much is this'. I don't know the prices of anything in there. So when you go to pay; WHY tell you 11.50; with gum; just say 12 bloody riyals! How the hell am I going to know?!! That way I won't get annoyed at thinking I am losing money. They could do this without causing half the arguments. Do I want to pay more for my shopping? No. But I have never been into a shop and said '20 riyals? I am SURE my bill is 19.50'. They are so stupid.	0

Hey QL; Hope everything is doing well! I have created this post in order to share everyone thought about customer service in Qatar! Share any positive and negative experiences that you may came along while in Doha :)	"One of the best customer services I have experienced in Doha is at the Commercial Bank. They never neglect your emails when you complain; they try to understand every detail of your problem and give you options to solve it; and they keep following up until you are satisfied. I have a similar pleasant experience with the manager of the service center of United Cars. He makes sure to read your emails and sends instant instructions to his employees to fix the problems. Unfortunately there are companies who don't bother if their customers are happy or not. They come from a background of: ""take it or leave it...you don't have any other option"" My brother experienced this lately with QGRABS. They sell some cheap quality offers and they don't bother to even apologize; not to mention a compensation."	1

You basically bought a brick!! Had you pre-ordered from Apples online store and had it shipped to Qatar via a friend in UK this wouldn't have happened. As off now their is NO unlock for iOS6 so until their is you have a useless phone; or brick. My suggestion is to call o2 carrier in the UK and ask if they can unlock the device....I doubt they will but if they do thats great. Or try to get a refund....	0

Do any of you use a GPS to get around in Qatar? If so; does it help or hurt more? I was thinking of uploading the Garmin Middle East map but one person told me it's irrelevant since streets are re-routed there often. Just thought a navigator would make getting around a little easier when we first start driving but I don't want to blow $120 on something useless either.	is the best time to drive around doha. no traffic roads are empty so go around and know your way its not really that hard.	0

No need wasting your money for specific GPS unit; all you need is just a mobile phone with GPS capability. Install it with GARMIN for mobile and complete the map of the area you need. Or just used google maps if you don't want get headache of renewal the maps. Im using GPS only to know where my position is and then figure out the fastest route because you know how often re-routing happened here in Doha.	1

HappyHorizon...Too lazy??? too tech savvy????? or just too much money??? :-) . No offence intended. Agree with Darude. Friday mornings are best to drive around in Doha. Most people do not get out of their homes until after lunch. The best way is to just drive around in squares. U will eventually reach your starting point. And yes; road works never end in Doha.

I bought a Garmin Nuvi some 5 months back; and it is soo handy and fun to use.. I Simply Love It.... :)	0
does anyone know?	I cant understand why people buy electronics in Qatar. I get all my stuff off of Amazon and have it shipped by Aramex. It costs me about 25% less even with the cost of shipping. Whatever you buy in Doha will be overpriced and out of date. The only advantage would be you have a local one year warranty; but those are rarely honoured anyways.	0
does anyone know?	@Secretagent69: How did you shipped by Aramex; do u need to have account on Aramex? I checked amazon.com and the price is really good; please help me i want to buy a laptop. Thanks in advance :)	0
does anyone know?	Sure. Just go to the Aramex office and set up an account. It's cheap and easy. Then use your credit card on Amazon to buy the laptop and have it shipped to Doha by Aramex. It will arrive in about a week.	0
does anyone know?	and how safe is it?i mean the online transactions for huge amounts.	0
does anyone know?	Online transactions are safe if you know your way around a pc. If your in doubt - use a pre paid credit card. I use aramex as well. The service is not all that great. They received two items from amazon on the same date and shipped one a week after the other. But amazon customer service is very good. You don't need to go their office to set up the account. You can register online from their website for a ship and shop account as well. Only reason why I would buy something from here over amazon/aramex is when I feel the local warranty is required or if I need it immediately.	0
does anyone know?	prices will be roughly as reflected at www.mydohadeals.com	0
does anyone know?	I would suggest to order online on www.aido.com I got my iPad in 3 days via aramex www.aido.com provided good packing also I also ordered ipad accessories from them	0

I purchased a Nokia mobile phone from Carrefour about three months ago. I can barely hear out of my phone now; which is a real pain in the rear; to say the least.

They can't do it on the spot bec they have other things to fix or attend which was first on the line. you have to leave it and comeback after a few days. As ive said; Amoud; its probably under service warranty of 1 or 2 years not so sure with 2 years. so it will be free for now. Im sure carrefour will just bring it to Consolidated for SErvice afterwards and it might take a longer time than bringing it directly to Consolidated.	1

If your mobile is under warranty..you can have it repair or if its beyond repair.. then they will replace the earpiece..like what happened before to my Nokia mobile.. I cant open it.. what they did.. they replace the face of the phone for which the on & off switch is connected( they change it cz it can't be repair)... Like Amoud..I suggest you go to Al Nasser Branch which is just opposite or adjacent of Doha Clinic.. say 100 meters opposite DC..you can look for Merla.. she can help you with your problem...hope this would be of help to your problem...	1

It was taken back from the Iraqis by a combined arab force including a lot (if not mainly) Qataris with American logistical and air support. This link shows you its location and notes about the event. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Khafji I believe (but am not certain) that it was also the main port for delivery of support to Iraq during the Iriq Iran conflict. For anyone interested; this link gives probably the best report relative to the battle. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/fogofwar/archive/post013191_2.htm	1

Never believe in painted pictures! better to live In Real world...... Getting a new passport..... Lol now days Qatar has I-print; the electronic fingerprint; so immigration will know who you are. Qatar is not India ...where everything is -handwritten. You are not unknown even with a new number; and be kicked out of Qatar....even if you try to come on visit or business visa. And even if you try entering on a different passport from a different nationality! Where you go outside of Qatar is fine...unless you on a security deportation from Qatar; no GCC will allow you in their country either.	0

just what to ask if it is possible to work in Qatar if you we're banned in Dubai?tnx!	Guys; It depends on the nature of the ban. Normally a ban is a no entry situation. If he is having a no entry stamp to Dubai then he will not be able to get visa to any of the GCC countries. The Immigration system of all the other countries will ave details of the person and it will normally block the visa. I know some guys in India unable to get visa to any other GCC countries because of the ban in Dubai.	1

The development came after Apple warned earlier that the update would render “permanently inoperable” devices that had been unlocked by owners who wanted to choose which mobile network to use. – DPA http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&item_no=175573&version=1&template_id=57&parent_id=56	0

Hi.... I was just wondering if anyone had any experience of working for Hamad Medical Corporation in Qatar? I have questions such as; how are they as an employer? What's the male staff accommodation like? Is the hospital and staff accommodation central to Doha? Are staff looked after? Is the work secure? Any experiences / knowledge / tips would be hugely appreciated. Thank you.	HMC hospital is the worst place in qatar to be employed. you will be working like slave from the first day. It is full of local arabs who will make any expat do always the night shifts and weekend duties.	1

What's the male staff accommodation like? Is the hospital and staff accommodation central to Doha? Are staff looked after? Is the work secure? Any experiences / knowledge / tips would be hugely appreciated. Thank you.	"The accommodation is perhaps a couple of kilometers from the center of old Doha; probably four kilometers from West Bay. I have heard that they don't like to employ Indians but I don't know for sure. They move extremely slowly whenever I have any dealings with them. Don't respond to emails; never answer a direct question; and don't return calls. They don't permit staff to access Internet resources regardless of need for job. I would imagine the work is secure because they are definitiely not a popular employer. Getting ""looked after"" is relative. You will be better looked after than someone in a labor camp; not as well looked after as someone feeding from the SIDRA trough."	1

One of my cousin is surgeon in HMC; has very nice FF accommodation provided by HMC in the HMC colony. 10 mins walk to the main hospital building. In outside market it must have the worth of 12K QAR rent per month. Upto some extent; racism is everywhere in ME. My cousin never reported any miss treatment due to racism though. They work in different teams and everyone share the equal load & night shifts. Overall; HMC is a good employer for him so far.	1

HUH legal adoption of who? The husband? :P If you are the one sponsoring your husband then you will be the one sponsoring your kids. If your husband wants to apply for sponsoring you and your kids then thats a whole other big process i think. If you have a PRO guy check with him which is the easy way out.	1

Huhhhhh.?.. You may need the legal process of adoption for your kids even your are their biological mother. Now that is plain silly....Adopt your own kids...what you talking about? But; smoke is right; you can sponsor your kids and hubby even if your spouse is not your kids biological kids; they are now his step children. Apply if you think you meet the new requirements for women to be the sponsor. On a separate note; your new spouse can adopt your kids; but that is not a requirement for YOU to sponsor your own kids. :)	1

Since you are sponsored by your husband; your husband can also sponsor your kids...just present your authenticated marriage certificate and ... i think there will an interview as new procedure for family visa by the Dept of Labor...i assumed your kids are minor? so there's a big chance that your husband can sponsor your kids since they are considered as his kids also by affinity . . .

Hi;I have a chance to relocate to Doha and would love to photograph the middle east bu.....can an american woman travel with her kids in and out of the country without a man or a exit visa?	Without a man you can travel anywhere inside Doha. Yes! it is not like America; very safe country. Nobody steal from you anything; it's 100% guarantee. Also; out of Qatar you can travel. But; you need EXIT PERMIT. Yes; even a MAN from Mass need Exit Permit once need to go out of Qatar. You are just an Amarican lady only.	1

Hi;I have a chance to relocate to Doha and would love to photograph the middle east bu.....can an american woman travel with her kids in and out of the country without a man or a exit visa?	"it depends on your visa. If you entered Qatar with the Vsit Visa; ou don't need an exit permit. If you came on Business Visa and stay LESS than 1 month; you still do not need a visa. If you came on Business Visa and stay more than 1 month; you will need an Exit permit. And if you have an RP here; you will DEFINITELY need an exit permit from your sponsor; unless you are under your husband's sponsorship. Whoever say ""Lady's do not need an exit permit""; have no clue what they are saying...again; all depends on your status here"	1
Hi;I have a chance to relocate to Doha and would love to photograph the middle east bu.....can an american woman travel with her kids in and out of the country without a man or a exit visa?	yeah; and exit permit can be done in 3 minutes over the internet if your sponsor has an internet access to it. otherwise it takes few hours.	1
Hi;I have a chance to relocate to Doha and would love to photograph the middle east bu.....can an american woman travel with her kids in and out of the country without a man or a exit visa?

Can a Foreigner (Muslim) marry Qatari Woman ? Any Conditions Apply ?	Sponsorship law gets nod Web posted at: 2/27/2009 3:38:52 Source ::: THE PENINSULA By MOBIN PANDIT and MOHAMMED SALEM DOHA: Qatar yesterday issued a new sponsorship law that retains salient features of the previous legislation; which was enforced some 45 years ago. ........... The new law (No. 4 of 2009) regulating the entry; exit; residence and sponsorship of foreigners was ratified by the Heir Apparent H H Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and will be enforced with immediate effect. Qatari women married to foreigners will be allowed to sponsor their husbands and children. ...........	1
Can a Foreigner (Muslim) marry Qatari Woman ? Any Conditions Apply ?	Non-muslim men cannot marry a Muslim lady i believe you will have to convert and face a tremendous amount of difficulty; this is not a normal event in Qatar. Other questions can arise about children; that's why u get married; in the past they could not automatically be Qatari! either way Qatar is changing; the fact that you can meet a Qatari lady and get to this stage in your relationship could not have happened in the past without male relatives deciding to avenge such an insult! proceed carefully!	0

HELP. I am currently dating a man who lives in Qatar for work and is from the UK. Lately he has been talking about me moving over there.  What do I need to know? Can a single man and women live together?  Any other important things I should be considering? I am 31; I like to go out for drinks and have a good time. Is this going to be an issue?	"Well; for one thing; you don't just move to Qatar. You have to have a residence visa; which means you have to be sponsored; usually by a family member or an employer. They're not going to let your BF sponsor you. Can you live together? If you don't mind living illegally; sure; you can live together. Whether this in fact turns into a problem will depend on a whole lot of factors; but you should be aware that it CAN turn into the sort of problem that spells p-r-i-s-o-n and d-e-p-o-r-t-a-t-i-o-n. You can drink; lots of people do (I do); but you will be in a Muslim country under Sharia law. You would be well advised to be very discreet. Lastly; Qatar would not be my first choice if having ""a good time"" were all that important to me. I think of it more as a place that one navigates as best one can. It's not all that bad a place to live; but you do have to be somewhat resourceful."	1

And as k977etc pointed out you'll need to find a sponsor; (i.e. employer) to be able to move here.	0

Can a single man and women live together?  Any other important things I should be considering? I am 31; I like to go out for drinks and have a good time. Is this going to be an issue?	Qatar is amongst the more liberal of Gulf countries I believe; which isn't saying enough because the Gulf does not even compare to the liberality of the fertile crescent Arab countries like Syria; Lebanon and Jordan. Though I personally don't drink; the vast majority of people I know do; and they do not seem to have a problem accessing it (which makes for some interesting weekends I can assure you!) Where in the US do you live? And what are your qualifications? Have you considered looking for a job here? If you are thinking about getting married to the guy; I believe he can sponsor you; contact the American Embassy for more info (though i never found them to be particularly resourceful lol). Their number is (974) 4884101. Good luck! Don't let one man's dream become another's nightmare	1

"Yes; you can live together - You'll need to be discreet; i.e. do not tell your muslim friends and acquaintances about it. Yes; you can go out for drinks - No need to be discreet here as long as you consume in bars and night clubs (which are almost always in hotels) and your home. During Ramadan you can only drink up at home and it's common practice to stock up on booze before this period. Also; never ever get into trouble with the cops when drunk. Drink driving is definitely not advisable. But; I agree fully with ""OOO"". Come in on a holiday and see for yourself before you decide."	1

Here is not Heaven. They have laws that the West does not follow. Here being close to or committing adultry; fornication or sodomy is not allowed. Also; drinking is not allowed. When going out you could cover yourself completelly (i.e. no hair; ears; neck; chest; arms & legs. No tight clothes are allowed too.	1

I dont think there is any problem with the issues you have raised. I have a few western friends who have been living together for quite a while now. Although they met each other after coming here and were on seperate sponsorships but ended up living together. As far as drinking is concerned. I do not drink myself (except water; juice & milk :); people say that they have absolutely no problem accessing alcohol. Hope this helps.	1
HELP. I am currently dating a man who lives in Qatar for work and is from the UK. Lately he has been talking about me moving over there.  What do I need to know? Can a single man and women live together?  Any other important things I should be considering? I am 31; I like to go out for drinks and have a good time. Is this going to be an issue?	He doesnt want me to really work there. I however; would like too. I am in finance and sales here in the US and do quite well. What type of work would I be able to find? How would I look for work? And is it hard to get a sponsor? And; thank you all for your help.	0

What israeli gov thinks it's doing by killing children and women ? like that gonna bring the peace ( not sure if they want it ) more than 100 killed in five days and who knows when they going to stop killing ? the side part is arab countries really silent these gov said nothing like they don't care. http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/52EF7122-5D4D-416A-B343-37118EAD689B.htm	Y are u only mentioning attack by a non muslim nation ONLY.

On Zionist settlers who were provided with Palestinean homes by their armies after having ripped off these homes from the original Palestineans? I think these invaders/settlers should go back to the countries they came from. ""There are women and children on both sides"" Yes! On 1 side there are the women & children of the original owners of the land who were living peacefully like every nation on earth; and on the other side there are the women & children who left their countries around the world; came to invade a country which don't belong to them; started killing the families of the original owners; and stole their homes. Now you can use your brain to judge! ""I am not a supporter of any violence"" ummmmm........me too! But if violence came to my home; then I'd have no other option!

What I do not understand though is why certain Palestinian factions continue to fire home made rockets into Israel. What good does it do? It takes away sympathy from the Palestinian cause and it causes innocent deaths on the Israeli side of the border. Worse of all; everyone knows that the Israelis retaliate with much greater force and cause many more innocent palestinian deaths. Stop giving Israel an excuse to kill. Use brain power not gun powder. Look to the examples of Ghandi and Mandela to make change and get the Isrealis to return to 1967 borders. These stupid rockets just cause more unecessary deaths.  	1

Hello Folks; I am Lebanese Male with more than 7 years GCC experience 5 Dubai 2+ in Qatar; I have been looking for a job in a good high reputable company where I can feel secure in Qatar; Doha.... Unfortunately All the job interviews or offers I get are totally bad. is it that hard to get a good job in Qatar or what? if you could guys provide me with a good recruiting company or name of any good company that hiring now. Thank you.	Hey ! Welcome to Qatar. Every job market has its fair share of positives and negatives. Getting a job in qatar is quite tough depending on the channel you use to source for jobs. Also depends on your expectations. There is vast majority of job seekers in Qatar who consider themselves qualified in many ways but often find out that the expectations of the employer are much higher. Also; you should try to be more specific. For eg: in the question you placed; you could have easily mentioned what kind of position you are looking out for to let everyone know in one go. But you chose not to. In addition to this; most ministries and govt organizations are implementing qatarization policies. So you will find a decrease in very 'high paying' jobs for expatriates. The private firm would not probably pay you as much. To avoid dissapointment you could try to filter the interviews coming to you. Ask before-hand what to expect in the interviews. The sources of recruitment / agencies are easily access.....	1

Crazy88; Thanks for your reply; you were right on why I didn't mentioned the job position I am applying for; but I was just saying in General; I mean I wasn't asking for a job more than asking about any company that hiring now and why is it difficult to find a high professionalism organization. about the recruiting agencies; I did many search and got many recruitment agencies; but thought if someone could provide with a good one.	0

Thank you.	You don't have to be defensive. I pointed out a defect that you can work on to get better chances. It is not about social network Vs Email to your boss. You can get a slight chance for a job offer through qatarliving. Would you rather hire someone that can't write correct English if you can hire someone that can? Also; why would you even mention what I have on another thread? You don't even know the full story? Again you contradict the true meaning of professionalism. My other thread is due to people who take money and give you a fake receipt and do not deliver. How is this my fault? Good luck to you; based on my poor judgement; you might need a lot of it.	0

In my view Qatar pay more Salary for workers in Gulf region. my friend argu Kuwait. which country paying more salary for workers?

In my view Qatar pay more Salary for workers in Gulf region. my friend argu Kuwait. which country paying more salary for workers?	I think it depends on your job but I would say the best payers are Saudi Arabia closely followed by Kuwait but neither of those places are pleasant enough to endure just for a few more bills in your pay cheque. The UAE pays ok and Abu Dhabi is a cheaper and more interesting place to live than Qatar.	1
In my view Qatar pay more Salary for workers in Gulf region. my friend argu Kuwait. which country paying more salary for workers?	The salaries in the Gulf Countries are not compensating for the inflation rate. Or do you know anybody who gets 15% salary increase every year just to have the same as in the previous year? In fact; salaries are reduced every year through inflation.	0
In my view Qatar pay more Salary for workers in Gulf region. my friend argu Kuwait. which country paying more salary for workers?	Yeah; may be Qatar. Simply because of the cost of living compared to other GCC countries much higher here. Saudi is not paying good salary for the workers. But the workers can enjoy free food and accommodation there with majority of employers.	1

In the other hand; for similar position; Arab Nationals is paid highest; followed by Western Expatriate; Arab Expatriate then Asian Expatriate.	1

How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	Just today i went for the workpermit medical. I think the process works as follows: 1. Your company applies online for WP and you get a piece of paper that it is issued. - Max 1 week. 2. They get a medical date - another week max. 3. Finger printing - another 3-4 days. 4. WP card - another 2-3 days. above days are just from my personal experience and may vary.	1
How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	Thank you Shapil for the nice Info. Do I need to do finger printing again since I did it last year when I first came her in Doha? By the way I am on a family visa sponsor by my husband. Was accepted for a job at a gov't facility and they told me to wait for there call in Gods will it will all be fine after 2 weeks but still did'nt recieve any call from them. Do you have any idea what procedure will go through since they get all the copy of my identification cards?	0
How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	Tepgam your situation is slightly complicated than mine...hopefully somebody else can respond to your queries as i am not sure myself.	0
How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	these are two different things.. Tepgam67 is asking about Work permit while being on Family visa. shapil is talking about residence permit. that's what happens when unprofessional people try to give an advice. Tepgam67; if you have an RP here; to obtain a Work permit you need police clearance and the contract certified in MOL. How long it takes to finalize the process depends on several factors. ometimes it takes 3-4 days; sometimes it takes 1 month and even more. If you don't have an RP here (i.e. you are on 6 months family visa); you cannot work; and therefore you cannot obtain a Work permit.	1
How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	QatariSon...my first response was based upon the OP which did not mention anything about the family visa and my second response after i was enlightened. Kindly revisit. Jumping the Gun is not professionalism.	0
How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	"i am not sOn; I am sUn. thank you. she didn't mention family visa; but she stated clearly ""Work Permit""; which needed only while you are on Family visa.

Wonderful Qoute; in your signature ""What lies behind us and what lies before us are small compared to what lies within us."""	0
How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	I did not know that the work permit is only required if you are on family visa. Enlightenment never stops. Thanks sUn. You are truly a professional.	0
How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	you are welcome; shapil; it is never late to learn. again you mix two things. You are already on Work VISA here in qatar. Based on your Work VISA you got your RP. You don't need an additional work PERMIT; since your visa is a WORK visa. Clear? Work PERMIT is required for those who are on the Family Visa and wish to work. The author of this thread is on Family Visa and already has her RP; I guess. She might stay in Qatar on Family visa without working (while you cannot stay on Work visa without working). But now she has chosen to work. And all she needs now is a PERMISSION to WORK (Work Permit). I hope this time you see the difference. If not; just drop it..	0
How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?	"bluesoul; it is not about capacity. shapil's ""capacity"" in Business Management Software Solutions Applications is definitely much higher than my ""capacity"" at the same field.

I would never suggest on any SAP solutions; I will wait till shapil - as a professional - will do it. Because my suggestion in SAP field will sound as silly as his suggestion in the field of HR and Immigration laws."	0

Thanks in advance ارجوكم ساعدوني	The immigration is not very keen on certain nationalities; and in practice work permits for them(including syrian) take forever. In reality; when it takes so long; employers often get frustrated and find another candidate to fill the job... and the immigration problem is easily solved without having to honestly admit that they just don't want certain nationality Don't quit your current job; and if you're still not working - keep looking for other options (outside Qatar).	0

Hello; I am thinking of sponsoring my husband to live in Qatar. I heard that if he gets a job; he will need to get a work permit. Are husbands able to get a work permit? And what papers will they ask for; is a police clearance letter necessary? Thanks.	I am from Europe and I have no problem with my visa. I can sponsor him (on a family visa?); but heard he also needs a work permit in order to start working. So my questions are a) can a husband under wife sponsorship get a work permit; b) what papers does he need; does he need police clearance for the application.	0
Hello; I am thinking of sponsoring my husband to live in Qatar. I heard that if he gets a job; he will need to get a work permit. Are husbands able to get a work permit? And what papers will they ask for; is a police clearance letter necessary? Thanks.	If he is on a family visa he needs to find a job first so that the company who will hire him will be the one to process his work permit. In my case the company who hired me did'nt ask my police clearance they just get a copy of my Passport; RP and copy of my Degree Certificate.I was already a resident here in Doha for a year before I decided to look for a job.	1
Hello; I am thinking of sponsoring my husband to live in Qatar. I heard that if he gets a job; he will need to get a work permit. Are husbands able to get a work permit? And what papers will they ask for; is a police clearance letter necessary? Thanks.	if you get over 7k you can sponser him with fam visa. once he is here and under your visa; He should bring a police clearance report from his home country (need to be attested by his Embassy here) so let him find a job; he will need to give the police clearance report and the company will fix him a work visa. (not the same as yours) he will still remain under your sponsorship. or different option if his job is well paid and he will get good benefits like tickets and also housing allowance he can ask his new employer to be his sponsor	1

Hello; I am thinking of sponsoring my husband to live in Qatar. I heard that if he gets a job; he will need to get a work permit. Are husbands able to get a work permit? And what papers will they ask for; is a police clearance letter necessary? Thanks.	bringing him on family visit visa (6 months) and sponsoring him for the Residence permit are two different things. Even IF you are able to bring him on a Family visit visa (6 months); he won't be able to work with this type of visa. The Company who hired him will have to issue a Work Visa for him and will have to take him under its sponsorship. As for the Residence permit; you won't be able to obtain RP for him (which is necessary for the Work permit) under your sponsorship. So this is not an option for you. All you need is to TRY to bring him on Family visa 6 months. THen he will need to find a job and to move under the hiring company sponsorship.	1

Hello; I am thinking of sponsoring my husband to live in Qatar. I heard that if he gets a job; he will need to get a work permit. Are husbands able to get a work permit? And what papers will they ask for; is a police clearance letter necessary? Thanks.	"even for ""husband"" there are certain requirements to sponsor his wife; such as salary; position; etc. For ""wife"" those requirements are much stricter. For getting a work visa and RP under the company he needs to find a JOB; and the hiring company must have approved quota for his nationality+ position."	0

I called Kaharamma and they indicated it coukd be an error!!	If all of our bills were estimated; then it is really unfair even if it benefits you by having less. More to worry if you have more that you are actually using. Perhaps somebody can add to this based on their experiences...	0

I called Kaharamma and they indicated it coukd be an error!!	i have the same experience but it has some readings... but the most important is that we jumped from less than 400 to 700QR this month...

QEWC should really look into this matter and fix it ASAP 'cause it is really unacceptable to pay x3 of your previous bill when the fact that you have consumed almost the same e/w last month	0

If they agree then the package is good unless you are not a heavy dirnker. Bilabong is on the spot with the rates. No.5 is optional and it would depend on the length of your stay. If you Rent-a-car it will be QR2000. If you stay for above 3yrs then it would be better if you buy QR2000 pm for 3yrs you can own the car (corolla/civic) & sell it for QR 25;000-30;000 when you leave Qatar. If your wife is here & she is not working it could be damn boring for her.	1

Sorry folks..I do confess to hijacking/sideswiping a thread or two (perhaps three?) but I'm used to posting on another website that does allow that and we get into some really great discussions that way. Didn't know it upset some folks; so I'll conduct myself more to the guidelines of the site here. I do apologize (excuse being I'm new....)	Me too do this at times. Not a big deal...don't feel bad... at least this thread we can hijack without feeling guilty.	1

Didn't know it upset some folks; so I'll conduct myself more to the guidelines of the site here. I do apologize (excuse being I'm new....)	Is that I can't see a problem with going off topic if the thread is a light one; such as Paul arranging a social get-together or someone putting up a joke for everyone to have a go at or add to etc. I think the problem is if someone has started a serious thread; which requires a discussion or even an answer to a query they have (if it doesn't fit in the more serious forums); then by hijacking it kind of kills the thread and serves no purpose. Speaking as someone who found this site when in the UK; before coming over to Doha; I typed into google a question about; say; sports clubs in Doha and found a thread in QL. It was informative; but I wonder what I would have thought of the site had the thread suddenly disintegrated in people gossiping and heresay and bickering? For a start I would never had seen some of the REAL info I was looking for and given up; as probably would have the person who posted the question in the first place expecting some knowledge to be imparted! OK - am going to.....	0

"Don't worry Scarlett; you are not the first and will not be the last. It seem to happen in the Qatar Living forum more then any of the others. Jauntie is right. I found QL by googling Qatar schools and I found this sight. If all I had found was bickering and guys trying to pick up women - I don't think I would have come back to it. It has been a big help. I have read so many of the threads and come back all the time to read more - informative and very entertaining. I hope to get there soon so I can join the Social Group. There are some very interesting people here that I would love to meet in person. I love meeting people from different places; cultures; etc. We have been expats on and off for many; many years. Nice to see another ""Southern Bell"" on the sight. I am not in Doha yet. My husband is there and I will get there eventually. Take care and enjoy your time in Doha. Lisa"	1

Thanks and hope to get responses soon.	"Um_Nooh and aquabong; With all respect to cleaners and tea boys. I do respect them a lot and if I had to use ranks; I would consider them all; way above most of the people who exercise a ""management"" position here in Qatar. Each one of them have a sad story behind them and most of them are heroes suffering under an unjust society. For your information; from where I come from; a cleaner and a person who serves tea/coffee; is regarded as important as a senior manager and their salaries sometimes are not too apart. The social benefits are equal. We grow up with a diversity of people and racism is just not part of our upbringing! My reply to Um_Nooh; came out that way because of the way she posted her question! Anybody could figure out that salaries vary in accordance with the activity you are going to exercise. Um_Nooh assumed that either we could guess her qualifications and targeted job; or whatever. My answer was deliberated for her to think about her error and at the same time to high....."	0
Hi all; I'm considering working in Qatar Foundation; but was wondering what the average salaries are for individuals working there; and what the working hours are like? Thanks and hope to get responses soon.	Nic - when i talked about lack of class and respect; it had nothing to do; and was not directed towards individuals that work as tea/coffee servers; and hence lead to me feeling offended.... it was directed to how you answered me! You were the person that I felt lacked class and respect (and that is without knowing your professional background). If you want to talk about answering; and stating things appropriately; you could have chosen your words in a more decent manner. Follow what you preach basically. The fact that not only I was offened but another member as well; who if I may add is NOT qatari; shows a lot about your approach. Please do not assume that just because I am Qatari; I do not value people that work as tea/coffee servers; or anyone else for that matter! Just as you assumed the worst in me; and thought I sterotyped them as being low class citizens; you were a hypocrite to assume that as a Qatari that is how I would think of them! The only person that acted wrongly is you.....	0

Thanks and hope to get responses soon.	Um_Nooh; Obviously there was a lot of misunderstanding maybe due to misinterpretation. But its all clear now. Now that you clarified your mistake (which triggered my sarcasm); what is the post you are applying for? Who knows who might become your boss! ;)	0

If you pay the penalty which is 10 Qr per day then you can renew your visa and change your sponsorship too. You have to pay your penalty only for 5 month not for 8 which is 5x30=150. 150x10 = 1500. either if you go to basmsahba or whatever they call it they will charge u the same amount and air tickets.and they will give the date . It's easy don't worry dear but you will be bane for next 2 year .	1

If you pay the penalty and renew your visa then you can change your sponsorship easy .if your record is good they will ask you to bring the police clearance cartifcats too or NBC (I think) from your embassy when you apply for sponsorship changing .	1

hey! am dying to know the insight of people who see non-local non-arab women who wears abaya....(women like me). im just curious on what others think...what do u think?	"what do I think? I think ""why"" ? but mostly i don't care."	0
hey! am dying to know the insight of people who see non-local non-arab women who wears abaya....(women like me). im just curious on what others think...what do u think?

hey! am dying to know the insight of people who see non-local non-arab women who wears abaya....(women like me). im just curious on what others think...what do u think?	thanks for the reply guys..like i said i was just curious what others really think. i just reverted to islam and i always feel that wearing the abaya doesnt give me the right coz im not arab and all.. i thought the purpose of wearing one is not to attract attention but out in public i always get this strange look?..or maybe im just paranoid.	0
hey! am dying to know the insight of people who see non-local non-arab women who wears abaya....(women like me). im just curious on what others think...what do u think?	You should be proud that your covering now because of your religion. Some convert and cant manage to cover with abaya at all. Maybe the strange looks are only in your head. Good luck and Ramadan Kareem!!	1
hey! am dying to know the insight of people who see non-local non-arab women who wears abaya....(women like me). im just curious on what others think...what do u think?	I was just about to post the same thing... here is my otherwise irrelevant two cents: I have been in many areas and functions where abaya is not an option; it is mandatory. As a *white* woman; I wouldn't think twice about people staring at me; thats their problem; divert your gaze etc... perhaps you are bit nervous at first; but you will become increasingly comfortable and not be concerned at all you will be proud of yourself	0
hey! am dying to know the insight of people who see non-local non-arab women who wears abaya....(women like me). im just curious on what others think...what do u think?	Lol; anyone can wear an Abaya. But if someone goes on the current trend of TIGHT fitting ones with shiny stones and designs; without the Hijab; and with DRAG makeup or in some cases they just let it all fly back while they walk into a mall making it look like an advocate coat. So whats the purpose of wearing the Abaya again; if you want to show your body to the world? lol; when I see the other nationalities wearing an abaya apparently they dont do it to cover their body; they do it to look pretty and to look Qatari :) Correct me if Im wrong. Hope your not one among these people. Once I was in Landmark and I saw a Qatari (I guess) with an open Abaya wearing Super man tee inside. What the devil did she want to potray? Lord Almightey knows alone.	1
hey! am dying to know the insight of people who see non-local non-arab women who wears abaya....(women like me). im just curious on what others think...what do u think?	"Every non-Qatari woman that I have come across wearing an Abaya is wearing it to try and pretend to be Qatari; not for religious reasons. Nowhere does it state in Islam that you must wear an abaya or wear a veil; so the ""Islamic"" reason is nonsense. Abayas are tribal/cultural; not Islamic. Flame on; my QL friends...flame on...."	1

Hi; My husband and myself will be relocating to Qatar soon; and would like to know the typical business dress code in Doha for Non Nationals. Is it OK for men to wear short sleeve shirts? For women; I am assuming the more conservative; the better..but what's more popular there?? long skirts? The Qatari ""Abaya""... please advise. appreciate it"	Yes it's alright for men to wear short sleeve shirts.Like you said the more conservative;the better and that rule applies to men as well.As this is a conservative muslim country;total respect for local customs and traditions need to be observed.Women aren't advised to wear sleeve less shirts or tops as well as shorts.Business dress code is the same as anywhere else.For men formal suiting and for women nothing specific bit it has be decent so as not to offend anyone and more importantaly;to avoid any sort of unwanted attention.	1

The Qatari ""Abaya""... please advise. appreciate it"	just for woman you can wear short sleeves and not above the knee length skirt or pants but the most important thing is your blouse should not reveal your .... when trying to pick up your grocery(as i've seen myself how the male cashier and other customers where staring at the woman with every procduct she tried to get from her trolly to the cashier)or if you have kids you have to follow or kneel for them ;so just something that will focus on your beauty in your face and anywhere else in the body;and good luck	1

Hi Ql frnds; After a long time now i have decided to make my driving license in Qatar. I have an Indian Driving license with me. Can someone explain me the process here and where should i best apply for the license? Thanks in advance.	I am taking lessons at Al Rayyah .. Have paid around 1130 for a quarter course...with 12 on road lessons and 6 theory /classroom/simulator classes..After taking 3 or 4 classes; pay another 50 QAR for registering for the test. Complete all your theory and on road sessions; and then take ur test. In case ;you( hope you do not) fail in first attempt; you can re-take the test by paying another 250 QAR. Failure on second attempt would entail you to regist for a fresh ( qtr;half or full )course all over again.Pay a small tip to ur driver and he might teach you some special lessons on clearing the driving test. All the best and hope you don't turn out to be just another brash driver speeding like a maniac on the roads here in Qatar Cheers	1

The time for training; preparation for exams and postponement of exams date and all is really frustrating but like someone earlier said confidence during road test; slow driving and observation and following basic rules will do you alot. The trainers give too many rules to follow but on the exams day; the policeman wants to see your confidence and application of basic control moves. That's all. I wish you the best.	1

hi......any one knows how to do drift with car?&where can i do it? like this! http://www.driftsession.com/galleries/desktops/drifterxldesktop.jpg	Things to do before you begin drifting... . . . 1. Set up a cone in the middle of the lot. Drive up on the cone and rip the handbrake in an attempt to do a 180. Practice this until you are no more; and no less than 180 degrees from when you started. . . . . 2. Learn how to countersteer by ripping the handbrake from a speed of 10-20mph and trying to control the car to a destination until the car stops. . . . . 3. Increase speed of each of these things until you are comfortable. . . . . . 4. try to do the 180 cone turn but instead of stopping; hit the gas hard and power out and away from the cone. Start practicing this first and let me know when you are confident enough about this... “We make a living by what we get; we make a life by what we give.” Sir Winston Churchill	1

My son was playing with some neighborhood kids and they had said to him that Israeli planes were going to drop bombs on everyone and that they kill people when they find them...got him really wound up and scared. So I explained to him that the other kids were Muslim; and they they believed certain things that we didn't necessarily believe in. They don't they don't eat pork; we do; we believe in Santa; they don't; etc. I then went on to explain about how some countries fight and go to war with one another and people get hurt and killed and it's never nice; but it happens. And hopefully soldiers try to be as careful as they can; but sometimes women and kids and old people and animals get hurt and killed by accident. It's sad but it happens. And then I explained that some of our best family friends are Jewish and/or Israelis; and I asked if he knew that (no; he didn't); and then I said that I didn't think that our friends were bad people at all (he agreed); and so I didn't think it was fa.....	0

Her son when it was coming up to national day told her that in NO WAY was he going to have anything to do with Lebanon because his friends did not like Arabs. This boys goes to one of the 'supposed' best schools in Doha.

So its always good to pay them some...after all they teach you the tricks of passing the test. Looting for around 500-700 Riyals is a bit too much. Normally people give them around QR-200 in equal installments of QR 50/- during their lessons.	1

Intercontinental Tent i think is the best... Very nice food; good sheesha and the entertainment is also good... Marriott wasnt that good; the food was nice but the sheesha was terrible as was the entertainment; small hall; no AC and very empty. Ritz Carlton.. Didnt go this year but last year it was amazing... Great Moroccan food; nice entertainment with dancers and live singers and the spinning egyptian man... great sheesha... I also heard that Diplomatic club is the best in Do7a but good luck trying to get a table; ive tried for soooo long and its always fully booked.. :)	1

Ah; sorry Voyageress; bad wording on my part. They arrive on 28th so will experience a couple of days of Ramdan. I've heard good things about the InterCon one on the beach as well; but last year we went to InterCon one when it was inside and it was rubbish. Last two years we've been to Ritz-Carlton and it's been excellent; but it's expensive and we fancied a change.	1

Indian extremist kill Muslims and Indian police involve in killing ALWAYS Terrorist; radical ;fanatic.they born more Taliban ; osama . see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1dbjWRSkLE	NEW DELHI — The remote; destitute state of Orissa; marred for years by Hindu-versus-Christian violence; erupted in a retaliatory killing on Monday after the murder of a Hindu leader led a mob to burn small Christian churches; prayer halls and an orphanage that had housed 21 children. The police said a woman’s body; charred beyond recognition; was found inside the church orphanage. The church’s pastor; whom the police did not identify and who was injured in the fire; told the authorities that the body was that of a nun working there. No children were injured. The attack on the orphanage on Monday; in an isolated district called Bargarh; came after the killing Saturday of a Hindu leader who had been associated with the Vishwa Hindu Parishad; or World Hindu Council; and who was leading a drive to wean local villagers from Christianity. Radical Hindu groups like the council are vehemently opposed to conversions to Christianity; which in India tend to focus on traditionally downtrodde.....	0

No one was injured in the latest attack in Orissa state; but police feared the arson will increase tension in a region with a history of violence along religious lines. Senior police official Gopal Chandra Nanda would not say whether the burned homes belonged to Hindus or Christians; but said an investigation was under way. The attacks took place in Tikabali; a town in Kandhamal district that has been the center of the unrest. Police have imposed a strict curfew across the district for the past week. The violence began late last month with the killing of a Hindu leader; which police blamed on Maoist rebels but Hindu activists blamed on Christian militants. In apparent retaliation; Hindu hard-liners set fire to a Christian orphanage; killing a Christian woman and seriously injuring a priest. Th.....	0

Indian extremist kill Muslims and Indian police involve in killing ALWAYS Terrorist; radical ;fanatic.they born more Taliban ; osama . see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1dbjWRSkLE	Terrorism knows no race; colour; religion or creed; but its main aim is to wipe out the human race and so we have to stand united to fight it and remove it from the root. Which is a very difficult task concerning the fact that every race; region has its own outlook on terror and wouldn't prefer others pointing at them. Look at what happened to war against terror witnessed in Iraq; Afghanistan etc. This is a big disaster and look at all the innocent blood stains; will they ever be wiped off? Whatever is done so far to remove terror is caused its evil head to reappear in another form. First the Muslim terrorist kills the Christians the Christians plot a way to tackle it calling it war against terror and creates terror in Muslims and the rest of the world; Muslims Terrorists killing the mostly tolerant Hindus causes Hindus to become Terrorists and this blame game continues. So the best way to tackle terror at present is to leave it to the world leaders. They will screw everything up for s.....	1

Don't you think it's also young men in their land cruisers also belting along roads at break neck speeds? and some people of both genders just racing into roundabouts without even bloody looking? Why just this morning on my way into work; a qatari gentleman in a really nice car basically barged into me and we would have had quite a bad crash if i hadn't been polite enough to just stop and let him in rather than have most of my car side taken off by him. I think it's more a case of many problems on the roads of qatar taht really need to be taken care of! And go Gulf Times for at least starting publicity on this subject- even if they have highlighted something we were all familiar with in the first place.	1

How many people did they talk to? What specific questions did they ask? Etc. However I do think there is some attention to the relative dangers of the road here given recent fatalities; but would not think its a bashing level... ... and it's always fun to yammer about driving here! ----- A wise young crackpot knows no fear - Ian Dury.	1

If somebody can clarify......	We are comfort to deal with same nationals and others are not considernig us properly; if an Indian goes to a Arabic shop he will not deal nicely; and he will not consider in respect at the same time if an Arabic customer comes he will leave the first customer and go behind Arabic customer; it is really true and my experiance; Indians are coming with mixed culture and they can accept anyone and know to please the customers. Customers are the Kings. finally if we need any indian items it is only available with Indian owned shops.	1

I always wonder; why Indians are so closed minded within them selves; they only deal with Indian Doctor; shop in Indian supermarket; etc..........unlike any other community Is there a reason for that? If somebody can clarify......	Supermarkets - We look for Indian supermarkets to buy Indian spices and vegetables which are not available in other shops. Doctors - Most of the Indians look for Indian doctors because of either language and communication problems or they are not treated well (attitude). Even I have noticed Arabs prefer to go to Arabic speaking doctors so that they can communicate thier illness better. Restaurants - We prefer all different types of restaurants. However; we avoid going back to restaurants where we are not treated well. Regarding other communities; they have no choice as there are not many supermarkets and doctors from their country.	1

Hi all.. We have a young baby [ 2 months old]. My wife has to resume work by the middle of September. We are looking for babycare options here. Is there any babysitting facility available in doha?	There is a regulated nursery service in doha but at premium rates and difficult to obtain a place; and now due to new regulations there are a reduced number of places. but with careful search you should be able to find a Nursery place. Do ask to see their Ministry registration. Outside of this there is the home provision by employing a Nanny; which is a costly activity initially. There is also many who will offer the service privately unregulated. Its your choice who you trust this small child with. Child care should be planned proir to the babys birth. we have nine months to plan for this day and children deserve the best decisions from us . check Doha Mums website . good Luck.	1

I employ a very nice lady from Philippines twice a week for house cleaning and she has accepted to babysit my daughter (18 months) on Thursday evening from 8 pm for a few hours. Could you tell me how I much I should pay her per hour ? Of course; we will also take in charge her taxi drive home. Thank you for your help !	That's also what I thought; 50 to 75 per hour is what I would pay in my home country.	0

I'm moving to Qatar in early 2008 from Canada. Can someone advise me of some good nurseries in and around the Qatar Foundation? Names/contact info would be good. Are any of them walking distance?

I'm moving to Qatar in early 2008 from Canada. Can someone advise me of some good nurseries in and around the Qatar Foundation? Names/contact info would be good. Are any of them walking distance? Thanks for your help.	Depending on how old your child is - Qatar Academy is right there. I think they start at 3 yrs old. Starfish Lane Kids is pretty close. My daughter has gone there for 2 years now. I like it a lot. You'll have to drive but it's pretty much a straight shot from the QF area. You basically have to drive everywhere here. Stafish Lane Kids - 580 5830; 580 5103 - near Landmark Mall	1

By the way; how much are these nurseries? Any discounts for more than one child?	0
I'm moving to Qatar in early 2008 from Canada. Can someone advise me of some good nurseries in and around the Qatar Foundation? Names/contact info would be good. Are any of them walking distance? Thanks for your help.	Just threw the price list away but we pay 1700 QR for 5 days a week for a 3 yr old. Starfish is a great place. Not a lot of turnover as far as I can tell; great play area; great teachers and asst. teachers; owners who give back to charity... I believe they do discount.	1

Thanks for your help.	"Do ""Creative Child"" and ""Starfish"" have websites? I did a search on google but couldn't find any. I was also wondering if you've ever considered a nanny instead of the nursery. What made you choose the latter? Thanks again for all your help."	0
I'm moving to Qatar in early 2008 from Canada. Can someone advise me of some good nurseries in and around the Qatar Foundation? Names/contact info would be good. Are any of them walking distance?

Daughter was going a bit crazy being stuck in the house with no friends.	1

Thanks for your help.	"rsher - Was looking in the latest Marhaba (welcome) book and saw that both Starfish and Creative Child take kids beginning at age 1 but if you get here at 10 months it might take 2 months or so on a waiting list anyway. Also; saw Mary Poppins Nursery. Haven't heard anything about this one except one mom was unimpressed when she saw a t.v. in one of the rooms. It's a little bit further down the road from Starfish. Emails - starfishkids@hotmail.com creativechildqatar@yahoo.com marry_poppins@qatar.net.qa (yes two ""r""s) Also; is there a Qatar Embassy in Canada? If so; give them a call and see if they can send you a copy of the Marhaba book. The Embassy in the US sent us one before we moved over. Lots of basic info on Qatar/Doha and pictures. Sort of a moving here guide."	1

Really really impressed with the setup; but I believe that even the waiting list is closed until March 08; so worth giving them a call. Our baby is 9 months; so we're looking to get him in there from April/May if possible!	0

Dear fellow; That's relative...Compare the offer with what you gettin now; I mean your current income. Similar to anywhere worldwide ; you can live on US$ 1000$ / month or your expensenses may reach as much as ten times (10;000 $)a month.

Don't forget annual vacation; family airtickets and medical insurance costs.... Good Luck	1

Thank you.	my stay in Abu Dhabi was unforgettable and i would aways prefer it to Doha but frankly the present accommodatipon crises in Abu Dhabi has made life impossible for people who are new there. the rent are soaring but there is a severe shortage of accommodation and so even if u can afford the rent; u are unable to find anything vacant.the schooling problem is equally bad both in Doha as well as Abu dhabi	1

This is true that these days it is difficult to find accommodation but if you ask your employer to provide you with the accommodation this will be the best solution. I am sure you will never regret the decision.Abu Dhabi has a future with so many real projects in pipeline and specially for a Quantity Surveyor with UK experience this job can be the base for other better opportunities. Good luck and go for it. Take my advise dont focus on present cost of living as these are highly volatile and misleading when I decided to come over in Doha April this year; it was based on good savings but in realty I found it other way round. I think when deciding about taking a job in Gulf; criteria these days should be better opportunity and quality of life and these two things no other city in Gulf provides except great Abu Dhabi.	1

While I am preparing to take the PMP (Project Management Professional) certificate it popped up in my mind to drop this question to QL community. Did the PMP bring any added value to your career development? either by adding more professional skills to you or helped you to find a better/well paid job?	A PMP certificate is not worth the paper it is printed on. Employers want experience; a construction/project management degree and evidence that you started a project and completed a project. I have reviewed many cv's and the majority of people with PMPs have simply not delivered projects; they have been involved; spent a long time ghetting all sorts of qualifications but when you ask them about the basics of project management their lack of practical; varied experience; shines through.	1

Did the PMP bring any added value to your career development? either by adding more professional skills to you or helped you to find a better/well paid job?	In my opinion it is good. I've been working as a PM n doing reasonably well.. but on taking the PMP course; I discovered loads of information on how U can better do the job. That there is more to PM than the traditional ways adopted. Especially since its done in a structured n organised manner and in international terms which ppl fr all over can understand and identify with. Having the PMP will empower U to take on PM jobs more confidently. Of cos experience also counts. I am curious how these so called PMPs got their certificate if they cant even vouch for some basic experience. All depends on individual dedication. I wud say go for it. Good luck.	1

is there anyone out there who is into train modelling? i've been in the hobby for the past 6months; collecting german HO models....	I did model railroading for a while some years ago (HO scale); nice relaxing hobby.

is there anyone out there who is into train modelling? i've been in the hobby for the past 6months; collecting german HO models....	my first trainset was also TOMY; that was 10years ago; which i handed over to my son which for now; only pieces of plastic tracks remains. i've got my first german model last year which is a starter set. i think its better that both you and your husband will be doing this hobby. What I am doing is that; i am the one who is in charge of the trains while my wife is the one who's constructing the models (stations; bridges; etc..). We're still waiting for the accessories that we need to construct our first diorama set (1200x600mm). try to go to miniatur wunderland website to check the largest modeltrain assembled.	1
is there anyone out there who is into train modelling? i've been in the hobby for the past 6months; collecting german HO models....	A few of the choices you need to answer before you get started are: What scale would you want to work with? What era or region of train type? How much space do you have for a layout? The two most popular scales are HO and N gauge; they would have the most accessories available for building a layout. With N gauge you could make a nice little layout on a desktop size area or smaller. With HO scale; you would need at least 2 desktop sized areas to make a small layout on.	1
is there anyone out there who is into train modelling? i've been in the hobby for the past 6months; collecting german HO models....	..as i said; the one i saw in kobe is still clear on my mind which is why i am dreaming of a town the size of a dining table..would that be too much to handle for a start..?..thanks for those nice inputs...	0

Guys; anyone knows anything about Bowling center? Is it functioning? where the location is? prices? working hours? thanx	When you go from Khalifa Stadium towards corniche; reach the firestation roundabout; take a right. You will get Athel;tes village on the right. Keep going straight and you pass a roundabout. Immediately after is an underpass. Dont go to the underpass; but take the road on the right of the underpass. You reach another roundabout. take a u-turn and come back and take the second right turn. You go directly onto the entrance of the bowling centre. Now about the price; It is the cheapest in the middle east. It is QR 10 for the first game and QR 8 for each subsequent games ( i am not sure about it). On Fridays and other weekends; you may have to book in advance. Its a lovely place with 32 international quality lanes. they have cafeteria and free internet access via wi-fi. Its a rockin place; though not many people know about it. For bookings etc; contact: Ph: 4353054; 4329132; 4329140 or 4329178. Their e-mail address is qatarbowlingcenter@gmail.com Whew; hope the info was useful. And like Mi.....	1

Is this still existing/implemented in this mall? what day & timing? TIA!	Fridays; sorry.	1
Is this still existing/implemented in this mall? what day & timing? TIA!	FRIDAYS ARE FAMILY DAYS AT ALL MALLS -BACHELOR'S NOT ALLOWED on those days . So on fridays ; bachelors cannot go to corniche ; not to malls ; not to souk then where do they do?They go the roof top on their bldg only .	1
Is this still existing/implemented in this mall? what day & timing? TIA!	ricky; it seems you are letting out your frustration.. You can't change the rules buddy..You have to go by it..You can't raise your voice.. Related to question; yes BACHELORS are not allowed on fridays in villagio..If i am right; then even city centre and landmark prohibits BACHELORS to enter.. Correct me if am wrong..	1
Is this still existing/implemented in this mall? what day & timing? TIA!	Soniya this is ridiculous rule . It is not the same in UAE or Oman or Bahrain or not even in KSA where i stayed alone for a couple of years . In Doha ; last summer -when my family was out of Qatar ; i was at office on friday and wanted to go to carrefour to buy something-villagio security blocked me . Ridiculous ; i m a serious buyer and needed to buy things . Then their head of security asked on cam -is the guy asian or british or european ; the nepali security guy replied asian sir ;immediately he said No ; block him . Stupid Rule .	0
Is this still existing/implemented in this mall? what day & timing? TIA!	Oh I see...so frustrating; anyway how about Thursday evening? (let say 6:00pm/7:00 pm) are we (bachelors) allowed/permitted to enter this mall?	0
Is this still existing/implemented in this mall? what day & timing? TIA!	Fridays 10AM - 8PM no entry for bachelors in the malls. I have stayed in Saudi; and ofcourse they do not have such rules coz they are closed on any given day (except after 8pm or so). They too have family days; and even in the parks only families are allowed. Next; i have been to the malls all by myself and noone ever stopped me on a friday. Irrespective of what time i went. This rule is to keep those perverts away who have nothing better to do but stare at women during their free time!	1

Qatar wanna HOST FIFA 2022 and make it for families only .	0

Does anybody know any official or unofficial hairdressers who can take care of african type (curly and hard) hair? My wife is desperate to find one.  Thank you in advance	..as my wife too will need them; particularly for stuff like braids and weaves etc. I walked into a barbers the other day and asked for a haircut. After they stopped laughing I realised this was a lost cause; and went out and bought my own clipper and shaving kit. :-(	0

Does anybody know any official or unofficial hairdressers who can take care of african type (curly and hard) hair? My wife is desperate to find one.  Thank you in advance	Braids is not such a big problem. Once I spoke to a kenyan lady who works for Qatar Airways; and she said there are lots of girls who do it (not in a barber's shop; but at home). Finding out who can do braids is easy; just ask (or better let your wife ask) someone with nicely done braids; who did it for them The problem is that my wife wants to stop using braids and do hair relaxation; treatment etc. In other words a professional.	1

Hair Salon - Has anyone seen a Loreal Salon in Doha? I would assume it may be in one of the hotels/resorts. The salon would have Loreal branding on the window..... Thanks S	"Do NOT go to Coiffure Francaise. I went in with very curly hair and asked Marie Claire; the hair dresser; to cut off ONE inch. She cut at least two inches off the overall length. I already had long layers and she asked me if I wanted layers and ended up cutting VERY short layers. She also cut the very front much shorter than the rest of my hair and then straightened the whole thing. I can not wear it curly because it looks REALLY bad. I have to spend extra time straightening my hair; and it's not growing quickly at all. I can't put it in a pony tail yet; and she cut it three weeks ago. If you see a girl around Doha that looks like she tried to give herself ""the Rachel"" at home; that's me. :("	1

My husband availed a personal loan from Commercial Bank of Qatar but just now we have accessed his bank accounts through their website and we are really shocked to find out that aside from the monthly payment (which we have believed interest of 10.99% per annum has been included; they are also adding up some amount on monthly basis as well. Does anyone of you encounter the same thing with CBQ?	If you go to the Sharia court they will sue the bank for taking interest which is 'haram' in Islam. If not; well; then the Islam in Qatar is a farce.	0

Saeedkan; we just decided to pay the amount loaned in 2 years time (24 months) and we have paid already for 3 months but tonight only we were avail to sign up from their site as there was previous problem & we were really shocked to find out that on the 1st month; CBQ had debited almost 300QR; on the 2nd month: almost 350QR and last month: almost 400QR.	0

Does anyone of you encounter the same thing with CBQ?	the amount that they are adding is the interest per month on your outstanding amount; the annual interest whatever you have agreed they will calculate monthly and will add on to your outstanding balance; that is quiet normal nothing shocking or nothing unknown.	1

Does anyone of you encounter the same thing with CBQ?	hms is right; if you look at the statement you might see the monthly interest added on to the principal and the monthly installment as a deduction. If you have taken the loan in Variable interest rate option; the monthly addition will vary as they periodically adjust the interest rates.	1

Does anyone of you encounter the same thing with CBQ?	Clearly you should be careful of the words that you use in a forum; because they can be easily taken out of context. By saying Islam in Qatar is a farce; are you attacking Islam; the Muslims; the people; the institutions...? The non-Muslim banks; and hotels that allow 2 of the biggest societal problems to occur have the blessing of the government... so whose problem is it; Islam's or the state's? And; although many think lightly of the 2 problems of Interest and Alcohol; society in Qatar ALL benefit from the laws that prevent alcohol consumption and their effects in public (if you doubt it; go to any UK city centre on Friday night). And those who think interest is not a problem; look at America and the foreclosure situation.	0

Does anyone of you encounter the same thing with CBQ?	Thank you all for your insights and hope that my query will not create any conflict; argument or whatsoever to anyone of you. As my husband & I were formerly working in Abu Dhabi; UAE and had also experiences availing loans from 2 banks. One from his side on a fixed interest rate & on my side; on a floating interest rate (which I believe is just the same as variable interest rate). Both of which; we had no question about or might probably; from where I got my loan; they have different way of reflecting the added amount in my monthly statements or I was not given enough time to discover about that as I had to settle the loaned amount after just 2 months of availing it as we decided already to move here afterwards.	0

I don't have any defernment; then I am very upset when I checked the details of my loan and found out that they add 5 more repayment months; for a total of 65 months!

Hello All; If you had a budget of 30K Qr mo.; married with no children and wanted to live in an upscale environment where would YOU live?? S	Saving money... good advice always!! Luckily Doha is a bit more about an adventure for both of us actually. We realized as comfortable as we were in the States; we were playing it a bit safe with Life. It's not that money isnt nice (it is) but the numbers are letting us pursue a bit of housing fun at the same time. Since my offer wont let me convert housing to a per diem I either spend it or lose it. Sooooo we're shopping around for the lifestyles of the not so rich but certainly shameless ;) Thanks Mandi; will check out West Bay Lagoon. Cristiani is already pressing me for the Pearl and since I'll be at the Airport; betting I'm in for a 30-45 minute commute already.... As a matter of biology; if it bites you it's probably female!	0
Hello All; If you had a budget of 30K Qr mo.; married with no children and wanted to live in an upscale environment where would YOU live??

Hello All; If you had a budget of 30K Qr mo.; married with no children and wanted to live in an upscale environment where would YOU live?? S	since you are working at the airport; check the villas at Al Fardan 1. It would only be a short commute. It it on D-ring road across from LuLu Hypermarket. I have been here for 5 years and seen a lot of different compounds. Al Fardan 1 has the most beautiful pool area and the villas are HUGE! They even have 5 bedroom villas with private pools in the backyard. By the way; it can take almost an hour to go from West Bay Lagoon to the airport in morning traffic. I know from experience. Consider this in your search.	1

Any comments would immensely help.	QF has a standardized classification level that ties in with pay. The pay level depends upon the needs of the job; not on your qualifications. $25K QR plus benefits is actually a really high classification level; i think as a Senior Manager / Director type of position. $16;000 QR is more than many teachers make in Doha; so I would think that is probably a good salary; but again it depends on the job. The Housing and transport allowance makes up for any salary discrepancies you might encounter. QF is pretty fair about pay; and is an employer of choice in Qatar.	1

I'd be the specialist and there would be a manager as well.	0

I work in QF; and I know they have a tier system of salary; and probably you fall short from the next category by only a small percent. Try bargaining with them...the housing and health package is good..as far my opinion..	1

So; I'd say if you like the job; go for it. If it isn't enough money; wait until a job comes along in QF that more meets your credentials. Mandi	1

If one with MBA and 10 years of experience as a top manager one day accepts an Office Boy job; he cannot expect manager's salary.	0
what is the normal salary for a PhD from UK in the government sector??

I went shopping to Carrefour and I couldn't find any of the Al Marai products.

Don't know. the last time i went there they told me they had the almarai products removed...wouldn't tell me why...so i'll just make it up... the managers got into a fight _______________________________________________________________ One of the hardest things for us to do in our human nature is to just stop what we are doing to allow God to produce in us what only He can produce.	0

I actually like this brand the most; when it comes to juices; milk; yoghurts...but I couldn't find any of them in there anymore. Anyone has any idea what happened? Why Carrefour doesn't have them anymore?	As a result many brands sometimes appear like they've been removed completely until they get around to restocking them.....which takes WAY too long for some reason. If there's something specific I need; I usually check out Giant or Family Food Center; and most of the time one of them will have it. Hope that helps. Stay safe.  Perfection does not exist. The question therefore; is: what level of imperfection are we willing to settle for?	1

Anjas; i said Carrefour...  Ragnarock; i know what u mean; but it is just weird that all the products from this brand were suddenly not available... so i don't think it was the issue of stocking up. and as Fembot said; they won't say why those products are no longer available. If you're looking for a problem; you're probably gonna find one.	0

I actually like this brand the most; when it comes to juices; milk; yoghurts...but I couldn't find any of them in there anymore. Anyone has any idea what happened? Why Carrefour doesn't have them anymore?	But like I said with other brands (though maybe with not as WIDE a range of products) they have gone missing for a LONG time then suddenly showed up....so we are forced to do the stockpiling thing when they ARE available LOL...sad; but this is how its done here if you want to ensure you don't run out of the brands you like. The best advice I can give you is ask to speak to a manager (in the admininstration department; not just a floor section manager in the store) next time you are there; and inquire about the brand specifically. And IF for some reason they did stop carrying it; you should be able to find them in other stores (unless the whole country decides to ban them for whatever reason). Hope that helps. Stay safe.

Would QRs.20.00 difference be enough for your headache?"	1
Between Carrefour and Jarir; which of the two has the lower price for laptops?

I have eaten meat from there loads of times and a bit concerned!	This is their second offense; I remember they had the same issues with the ministry of health two years ago. That was in City Center if i'm not mistaken.	0

Hardees; Mcdonalds; Jollibee; KFC; Burger King; Applebees + 60 degree summer heat = too hot to excercise = you'll both be 'medium' or 'large' size within a few months.	0
We are new Philipino couples comer in Qatar. We have attended many shops in Doha; but We have difficulties in searching the proper size of Asian ladies Clothes; Shoes & Sandals. Anyone knows? please inform us.. Thank you Friendly Couple.	Another one of these questions written most probably by a Qatarbeautyshop employee/owner with the answer being reference to Qatarbeautyshop in the first 3 posts... It is not difficult to find small and extra small sizes in Qatar. As for Qatarbeautyshop; i'd personally would not buy clothes online unless i've tried them out - and i'm a guy. Women are more picky. Moreover shopping in malls/window shopping is one big pastime in Qatar - sorry but your business may not be that feasible in Qatar. Nevertheless wish you all the best however please stop these posts - it is very cheap and does not look good for your business.	0
We are new Philipino couples comer in Qatar. We have attended many shops in Doha; but We have difficulties in searching the proper size of Asian ladies Clothes; Shoes & Sandals. Anyone knows? please inform us.. Thank you Friendly Couple.	I've never found it difficult finding clothes; shoes & sandals in any shop in Doha. You must just be familiar with your size. If your clothes size in Phils is Large; go for medium...if medium; go for small and small; try extra small. For the shoes & sandals; there is no difference with the sizes at all.	0

Plus Shangri-la; Rotana; Renaissance Marriott; Courtyard Marriot and Merweb of City Centre Mall. More placed to go to which means hopefully more clubs and bars..! :)	1
THE W HOTEL is opening soon at West Bay area. Anyone who knows about the W Hotels?	Hey San Diego; so pleased to find W fellows:) Indeed more places to go are on the way! W is supposed to be a very cool and New York style place - especially the living room concept. The word is that they are opening in May 2008. How come you know so much about hotels in DOha? You happen to read a lot or you work for the industry?	1
THE W HOTEL is opening soon at West Bay area. Anyone who knows about the W Hotels?	Hey; Its a black 30 storey building exactly acrosse the city center main entrance - behind QFC building.

THE W HOTEL is opening soon at West Bay area. Anyone who knows about the W Hotels?	"The W website says January; but word on the street is early spring. Looking at how fast La Cigale is opening; it more then likely won't be till late spring. It's the first of something like 14 starwood hotels that will be opening in the next couple of years. W is a boutique hotel; which means that all the furniture and stuff is for sale. Cool eh. :) Just google W for more information; I promise you won't just get a bunch of Bush sites.

THE W HOTEL is opening soon at West Bay area. Anyone who knows about the W Hotels?	"Well Shangri-La and Renaissance haven't even begun construction to my knowledge. The Grand Hyatt is well underway by the Ritz; it's supposed to resembel the Sharq Village and Spa. Word on the Street is that La Cigale came here with the promise that they would be allowed to serve pork by opening and now the powers that be are going back on their word; which is causing problems.

THE W HOTEL is opening soon at West Bay area. Anyone who knows about the W Hotels?

When was the first mall built? How did the malls affect traditional shops?	it was the Mall in Old Airport area build first. ppl used to go to THE CENTER near Ramada for shopping mostly the westerners.Than Landmark came up and City center and so on.

This is a question for the long time residents of Qatar. How was life like before the malls? Where did people spend their time; especially in the summer? Where did they do shopping? When was the first mall built? How did the malls affect traditional shops?	"You must also remember what was originally on the site of the Mall in the old arport area. That massive and squalid shanty town. The Center was the only decent large shop and it had BHS as one of its franchises although many of the items for sale were not BHS products; just BHS labels sewn on in the wrong place. There was a Shwarma stall in the car park and a cafe inside that served many dishes. Both were operated by ""The Caravan"". The only other shop of any size was Salam Studios; on Al-Saad Street. Now the site of the QP offices and HSBC. Salam Plaza didn't open until the early/mid 80's I seem to recollect. If there was something that you wanted and couldn't find; Globe China was the place to go."	1

When was the first mall built? How did the malls affect traditional shops?	There was no life without the Malls earlier; but i should say people used to spend more time at home getting together with friends or family... Like every said it was only center and then the mall in the late nineties ... But things have changed a lot since city center and the other malls have opened up ....	1

Location wise: Up from the Sofitel towards Rayyan Road somewhere down a little narrow street on the left. Cannot remember which street but it was past the one that had an Olympic Sports branch near the corner.	0

I would love to know more about what life was like before the malls but also before Doha was the chaotic city it is now.	0

This is a question for the long time residents of Qatar. How was life like before the malls? Where did people spend their time; especially in the summer? Where did they do shopping? When was the first mall built? How did the malls affect traditional shops?	growing up I don't remember any traffic jams!!! Life was calm and peaceful...I do remember going with my Mum to the souq for shopping (spices; perfumes; material for clothing; nuts; etc) Now they deliver to us! But we still go once in a while. I remember going to Europe a few times a year (staying in our houses in London and Paris and travelling around) and we would always have a long list of things to buy and take back. Clothes; shoes; medicines; foodstuffs...endless list. Now the list is shorter as there is so much more available to buy in Doha and online buying with shipping is easier. Some of my older relatives remember Doha as a walled city with a curfew at night. Someone came along to light the gaslamps (?) at sunset and during Ramadan someone came through the streets at Suhoor time to wake everyone up to eat before the fasting began for the day. Dweller; you've got a good memory...I had forgotten about Salam Studios on Al Sadd St. My Dad used to shop there a lot. I remember when.....	1
