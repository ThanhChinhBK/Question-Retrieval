What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April <num> , <num> ?	The conclusion reached by the government commission in the investigation of the circumstances and causes of the demise of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' is unobjective as regards establishing the probable cause of the accident , and as regards the evaluation given to the events that led to the accident 's development and to its tragic outcome , and as a consequence of this , as regards the assessment of the fact itself of the accident and the causes bringing it about .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April <num> , <num> ?	Looking at the accident of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' as an isolated case , and because the members of the commission belonged to the integral military-industrial complex , the government commission was incapable of objectively and faithfully revealing the real causes of the high accident rate in the navy , and of giving this the proper assessment .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April <num> , <num> ?	Ending our analysis of the tragedy 's development and of the actions of personnel of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , it should be said that the author does not claim to have the absolute truth in interpreting particular events and facts .	0

I am compelled to report , with Comrade Gorbachev in mind specifically , that the rescue chamber had been tested by the first crew of the `` Komsomolets '' during the period of experimental operation with the direct participation of representatives of the designer , the ship building plant and the navy 's search and rescue service , and that the testing involved actual separation of the rescue chamber from the submarine and its surfacing .	0

What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April <num> , <num> ?	As the division deputy commander Captain 1st Rank Kolyada bears a certain amount of responsibility for the fact that such recommendations were not drawn up for the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April <num> , <num> ?	During the accident the leadership of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' did not undertake any action to measure the parameters of the ship 's attitude or determine the elements of its buoyancy and stability , which would have made it possible to forecast the accident 's development .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April <num> , <num> ?	Analysis of the actions taken by personnel of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' during the accident showed that the submarine 's leadership had not given the order promptly to take the main turbogear unit -LRB- GTZA -RRB- off line , and then to seal off the bulkhead of compartment <num> .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April <num> , <num> ?	Summarizing all of the `` design deficiencies '' of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' stated by Captain 1st Rank Kolyada , we can make the following conclusions : Not one of the indicated `` deficiencies '' could have been a cause of the accident ; these `` deficiencies '' are inherent to all or most submarines of the navy .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April <num> , <num> ?	<num> . In conclusion we need to examine the `` numerous design imperfections '' revealed in the investigation of the accident aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April <num> , <num> ?	But if the highly placed authors of the navy 's remarks believe that all of these `` design peculiarities '' caused the accident and demise of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , and if they do nothing to prohibit patrol duty by submarines having such `` peculiarities , '' then what should we call them -- criminals or liars ?	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April <num> , <num> ?	The government commission left unaddressed many pieces of equipment and devices having deficiencies that were discussed in the examination of the circumstances of the accident aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' : the self-contained emergency buoy failed to operate after the submarine 's demise ; the sunken submarine locator failed to operate ; the inflating system of the PSN- <num> life rafts failed to work completely , `` by the book '' ; the survival suits and diving suits are hard to use ; the face masks of the IDA-59 apparatus are uncomfortable and unreliable .	0

What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April <num> , <num> ?	<num> . The assertion of the authors of the remark that the distribution panels aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' are not protected from the influence of oil vapor is inconsistent with reality .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April <num> , <num> ?	This system for removing oil vapor from air is also used aboard other submarines of the navy , and the `` Komsomolets '' is not unique in this .	0

What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April <num> , <num> ?	The shafting of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' is designed in full correspondence with Article X-75 of the TPPL-67 , which contains no requirement regarding the airtightness of bulkheads when shafting is operating at elevated pressure , as is asserted by the authors of the remark .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April <num> , <num> ?	As far as the essence of the issue is concerned , the bulkhead between compartments <num> and <num> is airtight aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' when the shafting is operating under normal conditions and at elevated pressure -LRB- within normal conditions -RRB- .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April <num> , <num> ?	However , the RBITS never was written by the Naval Institute No. <num> , and the navy 's Main Directorate for Operation and Repair did not plan or support its development for the `` Komsomolets '' in time .	0
