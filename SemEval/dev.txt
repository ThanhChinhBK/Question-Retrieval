Hi ti all QL's; What bank you are using? and why? Are you using this bank just because it has an affiliate at home? Regards;	Well Arman; nothing is wrong here with banks; I feel they are not up to par with UAE bank in terms of service at least not with the best which is abu dhabi islamic bank; but I have made an extensive review of QIB; IBQ; QNB and CBQ. I found out that QNB and CBQ are very dynamic; gives you a lot for cheap. My needs are: -Free Current account with no minimum balance with 2 debit card -Good credit card with airport lounge and added benefit -0% payment plan at good retaillers -Excellent mobile and internet banking -Cheap ATM and transfer for abroad... For the above; QNB and CBQ are the best. But it really depends on your salary too. IBQ is not very good. QIB is ridiculous.	1
Hi ti all QL's; What bank you are using? and why? Are you using this bank just because it has an affiliate at home? Regards;	With QNB for last 4 years plus...no issues...great service with a smile (mostly) from Qatari's (yeah dont be surprised) and now since they started QNB First it just got even better...:)	1

Hi ti all QL's; What bank you are using? and why? Are you using this bank just because it has an affiliate at home? Regards;	I don't know if it is the high competition? or No competition?? Is there any review issued by Central Bank? or any magazine ?? Is there any benchmark based on customer feedback?? When I searched QL there are so many disappointed and negative feedback from from bank clients I don't see the reasons behind it?? Regards;	0
Hi ti all QL's; What bank you are using? and why? Are you using this bank just because it has an affiliate at home? Regards;	Sheabi; the reason behind it; is that most people in QL have very low income; hence everytime a bank will take them a penny even a very justified one for a rendered service they will call them robbers...Also bank may not have the same level of service if you earn 2000 or 25000... I would advise you to find a the right branch and the right customer service agent; and stick to him to build a relationship. Because like everywhere you got some lazy people and you want to avoid them.	1

So experianced people your reply will be appreciated.	I was catching fish before on corniche and if i show you some of the photos you would not believe me. Now everything on Corniche is banned. No Fishing; No Playing Football; No Bikes; No setting on the grass and ... I don't know what is next. You can go to 'Khour El Edid' and see there. Actually on those open places there is no guarantee all the time. Even the area near the Ritz Carlton that we were going there before like 7 years [we were fulling 2 big Coleman Fridges which comes sometimes 12KG] it is now band. Good luck and if you know a new place; plz tell me. :)	1

Where in Qatar is the best place for Snorkeling? I'm planning to go out next friday but don't know where to go.	Hi Guys; Nice to have the locations for snorkeling. Is anyone able to be more precise and give exact locations. I know the time is close to be over this year due to gelly fishs. Anyway; please advice the best locations to snorkel. Thanks in advance for your answers	0
Where in Qatar is the best place for Snorkeling? I'm planning to go out next friday but don't know where to go.	I went snorkelling two days ago off the coast of Dukhan; about 2 km to the right of the Water Sports Club; near to the Desalination plant. Some massive rocks and colourless coral but there were quite a few different types of fish there; including some HUGE angel fish; very very nice spot. and yes... the jelly fish are here now!!!	1
Where in Qatar is the best place for Snorkeling? I'm planning to go out next friday but don't know where to go.	"Best places are Fuwarait beach - swim striaght out and there are lots of corals; different fish; sea greass beds and sea snakes. If your really lucky turtles. Anywhere north of Ras Laffan should be good. I was at Umm Tais Natural Reserves (mentioned in post above - turn right at Al-Shammal and head east; first island is Ras Rakkan and is harder to get to; go past until a hamlet and past this you can access Umm Tais) a few weeks ago; interesting place but Fuwarait is easier to get to etc. ""Sandy"" beach we used to go to; Al-Dhakriah mangroves. There is generally less to see on west coast than the east coast unless you go to places near construction which for the east coast is now a lot!! Hence i recommend French beach / fuwarait. There are also a few nice locations you can snorkell in the inland sea; although currents at certain times are very very strong. GO past coastguard station at mouth and head along towards Saudi until you see obvious shallows."	1
Where in Qatar is the best place for Snorkeling? I'm planning to go out next friday but don't know where to go.	From what you all have said; Fuwarait beach is a perfect place to explore; to enjoy and witness its natural reserves. Thanks for the share! I'm really waiting and seeking for answers of where to go and spend for our weekend vacation and adventure. hawaii snorkeling tours	0

I have enjoyed many visits to the island; and was under the illusion that it was there for everyone to enjoy. I could be wrong; but it would seem that it is probably going to be out of bounds to casual visitors in future. On the flip side; the island is man made. So I guess whoever made it must have had a good reason to pop an island right next to a massive new shiny international airport; and this is probably it. In which case; the owners can do what they like with their island. Well there ya go; I have answered my own question.	0

The purchase was done in Qatar but was not registered in Qatar. 3. The seller has authorised his shipping company to handle this transaction. 4. I want to know the procedure to transfer ownership of a car purchased in Qatar but at present located in another country.	0
I'll be off to Cairo in the next three or four weeks; since my husband has been transfered there for two years? Did you love living in Cairo; or hated it? Why? How does it compare to Qatar? Tell me about it... (Desperately trying to find a Cairoliving website!)	The one thing you can be certain of is that Cairo is not Doha!!! We are talking about a city of over 12million where the traffic is so bad (if you think Doha is bad...just wait) its actually comical. There is also no system and it is one of the most frustrating places to live in. Hope you are based in Zamalek or Maadi which are the nicest parts. But the lack of a system and the 'pushiness' of the egyptians will make you angry and frustrated.The poverty is also striking. And yet; and yet; in one street of Cairo you will find more charm; more magic and more life than the whole of Doha. It is a crazy place but a place which loves music and a place which is confident of itself (not surprising given its ancient history). It has the soul which Doha so lacks and because of that you put up with the traffic and frustrations. Egypt is a beguiling country which captured the heart of more than one roman emperor and many kings. Keep that in mind as you deal with the settling in period and once you .....	1

Celestvile; sounds like all the expat community lives in Maadi; and whilst I have heard that it is a quiet area with lots of greenery; I doubt it's convinient for us to live there as it is quite a ride from Giza; where my husband works. We shall see...we heard 6 October area is also nice? Besides; our housing allowance will only be $1500; which I think doesn't strech for a place in Maadi; and after living in a small flat for the last three years; I'm looking forward to a big place with a garden. By the way; do you have any idea where the french school is located? Dweller; oh god; now you worried me...with that kind of money I could live anywhere . Wonder why your son didn't like it.

Is 12;000QR a good salary for a single person to live on in Doha? The company will provide housing but no transportation allowance. Is this a good deal? thanks	It's not bad.

For a skilled worker from philippines - the normal basic salary is ranging from QR 2;500 to 5;000 excluding housing and transpo allowances. For professionals - salary is ranging from QR 8;000 to 45;000 depending on the qualification and industry. I know some colleagues in oil & gas; banking industry and investments are even receiving between QR 50k to 80k per month. So it all depends on your qualification and work experiences. Good luck!	0

For your food alone you have to shell out at least 800 riyals per month. Your personal needs is an additional cost of 200 riyals. So total you'll have a net salary of 2000 riyals or about 500 dlrs. Socializing is another strain in your pocket. But it's okay as long as you follow the good manners and right conduct of being a foreigner here. No public display of affection and you must dress up modestly. If you think 2000 riyals is enough savings for you then good luck and welcome to Doha.	1

Also the Qp Housing Allowance it divided into 2 Basic 4000 Supp 3500 Will ge the total of 7500? thank you"	"""indefinite"" here actually means ""unlimited"" its unlike the contracting companies offer during the project work. You will be demobilized after the project is compeleted; but as your contract is ""indefinite"" its because you are a direct employee and do not have a specific term after which its a much for you to be demobilized..!! best of luck..! may you grow maximum & fetch greater scope. :) btw; what position did you get in??"	1

Thanks very much	"45;000 per month should easily afford you a very lavish lifestyle i would think. 10;000 a month for housing probably won't get you the pool that you desire; housing is insanely expensive in this country. If you must then i would put a bit of your own salary into securing the type of residence you really want; like novita77 said i would think 15000QR would get you a very nice place. you would still have plenty of cash left over to ""live it up"" esp if they are also giving you a car allowance like you stated in your post. QP is a well respected company that hires many foreigners. As every job i highly recommend you get everything in writing and signed by both parties."	0

Dear friends; First of all; iÂ would like to thank you all for your amazing help and support. actually i got an offer from QP and it was good. they have requested to undergo a full medical examination and i did that and sent them the report through courier. i just wanna know; what&#39;s the next step in the recruitment procedure and how long time it takes from then to issue meÂ work visa? I will appreciate if any can help me. Regards;	QP should be able to get it done for u in 2 weeks.	1

I will appreciate if any can help me. Regards;	NEXT STEP... I have explained this earlier and I will repeat it again..so that no one gets caught in an uncomfortable situation....Getting an offer and submitting a medical in QP is NOT a signal to move...Until you get the final offer letter and see the visa in your Inbox..DO NOT RESIGN..I am sure in their Email offer to you they will advise you not to resign until told... In QP things move according to your mobilization date..and getting your VISA is not a big deal for QP...However the actual date of mobilization is pre-determined..... QP is usually too far ahead on the block before the mobilization date at times... The next step in your recruitment process is waiting and asking questions if you have any...Your VISA Could be ready in 1 month..or it can also be 4 months..so just wait..and DO NOT RESIGN from your current job....	1

The two days will allow enough time for you to undergo a medical; meet other staff/management; have a look around Doha; at housing available etc. Good luck.	1

hi all. I am planning on coming to doha with my 3 week old baby who has only got her BCG vaccination. I am wondering if its advisble to come and get the rest of her immunisations there in doha; or is it better for me to get them done here before travelling there to doha? has any one had their child vaccinated here in doha? thanks in advance xoxo	I would get all the vaccinations done before you come. There are lots of good hospitals here; so it is not a problem. However; I think you need proof of vaccination in small kids before you entry the country. I may be wrong. My thoughts are my own; but I doubt my Mum would agree with some of them.	1

I am wondering if its advisble to come and get the rest of her immunisations there in doha; or is it better for me to get them done here before travelling there to doha? has any one had their child vaccinated here in doha? thanks in advance xoxo	If you go to Hamad Hospital vaccines for kids under 1 are free. You can go to the private hospitals but they are much more expensive unless you have insurance that cover them. Both my kids were completely vaccinated in Doha (born here; now 1 and 3). The only concern might be transferring the records to your home country when you return. Each country has different vaccine schedules. But; if you are here for a while you might as well do the Doha schedule and finish it all here. For example; in the US they don't do BCGs; but since I figured my kids would be here the first few years of their lives so it was probably a good idea to do it. I'm pretty sure you don't need all the vaccines before arriving in Doha. Check with your employer; but I can't imagine they will turn away your 3 month old w/o vaccines since I know they don't check vaccines for adults at all!	1

Hamad; Doha Clinic and Al Ahli... We didn't have insurance for a while; and we also wanted to try different places to find the best one. If you don't have insurance; I'd recommend the local clinic of Hamad. The vaccines are free there for babies under 1. They only do vaccines a couple of times a week; so make sure you stop by first to check the hours (you'll need a medical # first; so bring the baby's RP; birth certificate; etc). You won't find many westerners there (or perhaps that's just my local branch) but they speak english well enough and it's free! If you do have insurance; I like Doha Clinic. Staff is helpful and friendly (except Dr Khalid; he's a bit harsh- yelled at my mom once for trying to come to the appointment with me) and there isn't much of a wait. I used to go to Al Ahli but recently their waits have become hours long (with appointments!) and since they have a ""great"" kids play area; my kids were always coming home with some nasty sickness when w....."	0

Thanks	hi; As of my knowledge; The National health center @ Abu hamour responsible for medical tests (once entered into the country;used to go for medical)only not for vaccination. For vaccination u need green card for the kid; for that u have go to Health commision back side of Hamad hospital ( from sports R/A to Fire station R/A; take right turn from Fire station R/A) approaching 200 mts one very big building. But yesterday she asked me r u from india; then she told it's in other place;i.e opp to Aldana hotel near sana R/A; one more medical commission is there. But they will give green card only and after that u have to go to u r regular health center; they will give the registrastion no and vaccination timings details. note: for issuing green card they need previous vaccination history record from u r county. if u have any doubts call to medical commision near aldana hotel @ 4312054 Thanks	1

I am in the process of coming over to work in Doha. I wanted to know if their were any specific shots and vaccinations I should get before coming over. I want to try and get these things completed before I leave the US. Any insight would be much appreciated.	Yes there are; though it varies depending on which country you come from. In the UK; the doctor has a list of all countries and the vaccinations needed for each. I'll imagine they have the same in the US.	1

You don't specifically need any extra vaccinations as long as you are up to date with the usual ones you have in the UK (not sure about US) but you can have Rabies as optional if you want. Although there is no requirement or need to have any extra protection here; it is important to remember that lots of people travel East on holidays and if you do you will need the standard typhoid; yellow fever; etc. Children need to have been vaccinated against TB before they can start school. In the UK they no longer give BCG so important to get that done before you come.	1

Doctors also didn't advise me to take any. I think you should be good as long as you have had the ones you had as a child. And even if you didn't; your body has an immune system so it will be able to fight off the most not so serious diseases. TB would be smart to have though!	0

As I said; the official advice is that you don't HAVE to; however; they may offer you Rabies; Typhoid and Hep B as an option. As they no longer boost Tetanus as routine; you would have to have a booster before coming. That said; the UK has a vey hands off approach to immunisation at the moment as most diseases are sufficiently covered by herd immunity (where because the majority have been vaccinated the people who haven't are covered to a large extent) and cases are low. Personally as long as there is a low risk; I would have all the vaccinations I could; why not?	1

I am considering getting a job in Qatar and I have two very well behaved people friendly spayed pitbulls. Apparently this breed is banned. Would I have trouble importing them? If anything happened to the dogs; my husband would die; and he will not leave them in Canada if we go away. So I have to be sure they would be ok to be imported before considering taking a job.	If they are 'banned'; as you suggest; then it obviously means that your are not allowed to bring them into Qatar.	1

Thank you and it's good to know that there are some moral and responsible pitty owners in Qatar; some of the web sites I've seen make me sick at how people are taking these normally people loving animals and misusing and abusing them for sport (and then people who aren't informed blame the dogs who are the ones being abused; not the ones doing the abusing in the first place).	0

"One caveat - if you can (and there are official channels to follow) get your dogs here NEVER leave them alone or off leash - not because of them but because of the sickos who see the breed and assume they are fighting dogs. I have a shepherd and I've lost count of how many times someone has wanted to ""buy"" her - she's big and black and they see her as a fighter because of that."	0

Yes you can bring it but be careful this kind of dog is very very very dangerous. Because I have one that my friend brought it to my last year from Kuwait.

I've seen garden parties driven indoors cos it was just too chilly to sit about. Humidity is a factor; and can make it seems colder than the thermometer would suggest.	1

The jacket that we usually used on the cold rainy season will do as weather is not extremely cold in Qatar. It is still manageable. Don't bring too much clothes; you can buy from Qatar whenever you want to. There are clothe shops that are affordable and there is always on sale items.	1

Anti biotics; Ive heard don't work (?)As for the Vit C; the Dr did give me some and and feel better for a while and then returns again. Might go back and get a truck load.	0

Thanks	I'm not expert or doctor neither as far as i know any throat infection or cough inflamation that lasted a week or more than it is already a allergies. if you have doubts on your doctor's prescription better yet get second opinion. Note: Antibiotics here in Doha are controlled drugs so you cant just buy it in by the counter you must have prescription.	0

i am just curious how cold is doha during winter?	In 2006 it was a lovely winter. It was dark; cloudy and rained for almost every day in December. We got trapped in Doha on new years eve and were unable to get to Dukhan such was the torrential rain. It rained on and off until April and then warmed up. The coldest night was 5C but generally 7C. I remember it rained when my parents were here and that was April 2007. This last winter wasn't very cold at all; only a few days of rain and never really got below 10C at night. I love winters here; they are so cosy. On the down side; houses are not built for winter so prepare to freeze and get leaks driping everywhere. The roads don't drain very well so very wet.	1

In his previous lives; he was a cat got abandoned near a dumpster by his owner. Sad story; really. QAWS is still operating but only until the end of September. Visit their facebook page if you want to see what cats are available for adoption. It cost 500QR per cat for their vaccination; neutering and microchip.	1

1. Where can I buy/adopt a cat? Other than the pet place in souq waqef 2. How much does cat grooming cost in qatar? 3. How much does vets consultation cost ? On average..	1. QAWS (shutting down end of September; so please consider this your first stop as they have tons of animals to rehome); 2nd Chance Rescue; Cats in Qatar; and Qatar Veterinary Center. Look them all up on Facebook for news and pictures of their current adoptable cats. Some ask a small fee to cover money already spent on the cats spaying/neutering; microchip and vaccination costs; and some are completely free. 2. Depending on the kind of cat and where you go; it can be from 75QR to as much as 250QR for grooming. More reputable places such as the big vets (Parkview & QVC) will charge more. 3. Anywhere from 100-500QR depending on what you need done.	1
1. Where can I buy/adopt a cat? Other than the pet place in souq waqef 2. How much does cat grooming cost in qatar? 3. How much does vets consultation cost ? On average..	Grooming isn't really necessary unless you get a persian or long haired cat. Save yourself the money and hassle and get a short haired Arabian Mau. They're hearty cats and you won't have a lot of health problems with them which will cut down on Vet costs. :)	0

Dear Dog Lovers in Qatar; Here's a query for u ..myself went to SQ WQF and fell in love with a 1 month old pup........he was so cute....dint have the heart to leave him there.... he was costing 1800/- bucks. Please let me know; if anyone has bought a pup from this place. Also; let me know if it can be kept in a flat ...since its quite small. I need to keep one coz i want my doter to have the experience of having and taking care of a pet.	NO! A one month old puppy isn't old enough to leave its mother and anyone selling it knows nothing about dogs or their care or their health. You will be getting a sick dog that will cost you tens of thousands of riyals over the next months or years.	0

I need to keep one coz i want my doter to have the experience of having and taking care of a pet.	A better and more deserving place to get a pup is from the Animal care centre - it used to be called 'Paws and Claws' - not sure what it is called now. We got a Saluki pup from there for our daughter and he is now a grown dog; an absolute darling and a stress reliever for my daughter and everyone else in the house. When we got him; he was not even a month old and his eyes were not yet foccused. I understand his parents were running wild on a farm and the cops came; rounded them up and shot the parents; but Paws and Claws saved many of the orphaned pups and brought them to their centre. We paid them only QR 100/-as donation for the pup. He had diarrohea and needed treatment thereafter. There are good vetinary clincs in Doha; but still it is a bit expensive. Even then; it is worth spending on a pup which your daughter can cuddle; hug and love. If things go rough in school and her friends and teachers are mean; the dog is someone she would try to confide in; althought is cannot speak back.....	1

I need to keep one coz i want my doter to have the experience of having and taking care of a pet.	Buying a dog/puppy for your daughter is a very big decision. You have to consider many things before you decide on something. We have got a Shiranian (ShihTzu+Pom) for our 3yr old son; believe it was a very good decision; both are very good pals now. Factors: How old is your daughter? If she is below 5 years; make sure she have a toy group; very quiet and playful puppy. If she is bigger may be you can get a bigger one. Because size and attitude of dog will matter Is your daughter asthmatic or ill constantly? Get low shedding or no shedding dogs. Is she ready for responsibilities? Can she clean; groom your pet. If not; you should be ready to do it for her; so that she doesnot feel distant from her pet. Flat? Staying in a flat; then you have to definitely get a quieter dog so that your neighbours dont complaint against you and regarding toilet training you dont have to worry; it will be tough initially but be persistent and you can work it out. Use a crate initially to keep your pet and .....	1

I need to keep one coz i want my doter to have the experience of having and taking care of a pet.	Unfortunately the animals sold at Souq Wagif are in miserable condition so you will pay 3 times what you paid for the dog just to get it healthy. I was in search of a Siamese cat and bought a kitten there it took 3 weeks of hourly care and lots of Vet bills to keep the animal alive. Its a shame the govt. does not close it down its a menace to animal lovers. So don't buy the puppy and as stated its too young as well.	1

I need to keep one coz i want my doter to have the experience of having and taking care of a pet.	I wouldn't reccoemnt buying any animals from the souq. They are seriously mistreated (you only have to go and see them kept in the cages and sprayed with water to see that) and by buying one of these animals you are only further encouraging the sellers to mistreat animals. As others have said; there are better places to get animals (such as any of the vets who always have animals for adoption either in the centre or advertised on the boards). Finally; please consider if you and your daughter are ready for a dog. I personally; wouldn't have a dog in a my small 2 bed flat. I do; however; have a cat. Dogs must be walked every day (even in the heat of summer);. What will you do if you go on annual leave? Dogs are more expensive to be looked after than cats because they need more attention. Are you ready to pay high vet bills if your pet gets sick and can you afford the right amount of food every day? If you are confident that you are ready for a dog; then I wish you and your daughter the b.....	1

I need to keep one coz i want my doter to have the experience of having and taking care of a pet.	PLEASE DO NOT BUY ANY DOGS OR CATS FROM ANY SOUQS OR PET SHOPS! A 4 week old puppy should still be with it's mother. The chances are that if you take it home; you will get attached to it and then it will die. It's too young to be away from it's mum; it's too young to be vaccinated; it won't have had proper puppy formula or health treatments. Please save yourself a lot of heartache and stay away from dogs and puppies in the souqs. They are normally sick; not vaccinated or too young. Some have diseases that can be passed to humans and you never know if the dog maybe belongs to somebody already and it has been stolen/found and sold to the pet shops. If you seriously want a dog and are ready for the committment for the next 15 years; please contact one of the animal rescue groups or adopt a pet from a family. And make sure that whatever animal you get - it must have been vaccinated and neutered.	0

I'll be leaving Qatar in a few months.  I want to sell my car.  How long does it take to sell a car?  A few weeks?  One month?  A few months?	I have posted two ads in QL classifieds but I'm wondering how long to hold off for a better price.   I've already got phone calls from guys who want to buy.   I'm selling a 2001 Beetle (hopefully for QR25;000) and 2001 Honda (hopefully for QR20;000).  I just like the year 2001 (I'm a Stanley Kubrick fan).  I plan to rent a car for the last few weeks that I'm in Doha.  But I don't wish to rent a car for too long.  How long before leaving to take an offer?  I'm wondering how long have others taken to sell cars.	0

Having read a lot about about the 'hectic' driving in Doha I was wondering whether car insurance is quite costly. I'm a 25 year old male from the UK and I've never made a claim; am I likely to be paying through the roof to insure my V8 4x4 that I intend to buy when I move to Doha next month?	Insurance is between 3% and 4% a year...and seriously; while the driving keeps you on your toes...it isn't THAT bad!	1

Is that a percentage of the cost of the car? It can't be much worse than the M25 in the UK during rush hour; that's pretty much a 80mph free for all anyway!	0

Yep...as a percentage of value of car. I recommend you first hire a car for a week or two so you get used to the roundabouts with someone elses wheels *g*	1

I'm a 25 year old male from the UK and I've never made a claim; am I likely to be paying through the roof to insure my V8 4x4 that I intend to buy when I move to Doha next month?	Well; it is 3% in the first year anyway. I think the insurance companies might have agreements with the insurance carriers and direct buyers to a particular insurance agency. Invariably you will return to the insurance company you used when you bought the car. When the annual renewal comes up though you may find that it is way higher than 3%! Or else we weren't skilled/persistent enough to negotiate it down to 3% :) Here is a short blog about our experience with car insurance renewal. http://tinyurl.com/elmrk from my blog about life in Qatar: http://www.xanga.com/BBetz	1

Life only can be understood backwards; but must be live forward. Car insurance not really that bad. In the UK you insure the driver ... in here you insure the car. So anyone can drive the car and still insured. If you know what i mean. We pay around 2000 QR for our cars. Again our car are not a posh car. :-)	1

I think you will find that the car is covered for accidents but not people in the car. You may need to take out seperate insurance for the passengers. Fully comprehensive in Qatar is not the same as fully comprehensive in the UK	1

I'm a 25 year old male from the UK and I've never made a claim; am I likely to be paying through the roof to insure my V8 4x4 that I intend to buy when I move to Doha next month?	Car Insurance is quite different from Western practices. As noted above; you insure the car; not the driver; which is one of the reasons kids here can afford to drive massive landcruisers; despite the slaughter of pedestrians. (Blood money for non-Moslems is pretty minimal; anyway.) For cars over a certain age; (2 years? Dunno) 3rd party is the only option. however; and again as noted above; cover for passengers is not automatic so check these things carefully with your Insurance Broker. Even the possibility of having residual alocohol in your bloodstream when some idiot slams into you some morning has to be specifically covered; so it's not a bad idea to go to a reputable international Insurance company if you think you might occasionally have non-family passengers or drink beer of an evening.	1

When you take out full insurance; you will normally be offered the choice of insuring the driver and ex-number (you chose) of passengers. Additionally; as stated; you can insure against being over the limit (excess alcohol); although I do not know what would happen if a driver was drunk and had an accident.	1

While driving in Doha last night I witness a sad incident. A man was driving with his child on his lap. He had to make an emergency stop and his childs head impacted the steering wheel. The poor child was bleeding and crying. Many times I have seen children not properly secured in vehicles. Is there not a law regarding child safety in vehicles here in Qatar?	there is a law. No children under 10 in the front seats. Unfortunately this law is not enforced. Did you take the guys license plate # and report him? Maybe if he got a large fine it would impact him rather than his child. poor child has an idiot for a parent.	1

I see children with no seat belts on all the time. Jumping up and down in the back; on someones lap in the front and leaning between the 2 front seats from the back!!! Do some parents not care for the safety of their children or what????? There are so many accidents here and a child would fly through the front window should a car have an accident and most probably result in death.

I hate to say this: Body bags come in many shapes and sizes; lately toddler size is very common. I lifted two body bags in my life and plenty of coffins.

"in this region subscribe to. But in the end; it's just a stupid rationalization for not doing what would keep your children safe. Especially in light of recent stats on road injuries per capita in Qatar (""Qatar suffered four times more injuries in road accidents per 100;000 people than the second-placed country; Kuwait; and tied with South Africa for the most road deaths; the report shows.""); you'd think they might want to start enforcing the laws on the books.

What carseat brands are available in Qatar? I´m just not sure if I should bring the kids carseats from Norway; not sure how the airlines will treat the seats; and are a bit worried that they will break them.	"While car seats are available in Qatar; they're bound to be pricier than the ones you have already; and the selection will not exactly ""wow"" you. Unfortunately I can't tell you what brands are available here since I haven't paid them any attention. I brought my two Britax Boulevards with us from the U.S. and they came through fine. I do recommend purchasing car seat travel bags if you can find them in Norway because it will definitely help keep the cloth cover in better shape. If you can't find them; though; the airline will put it in a very heavy-duty plastic bag. Hope that helps; Expat Sueño P.S. I am starting a Mums and Kids group here in Doha for expats. Be sure to get in touch with me when you arrive (or before if you have any questions).

I´m just not sure if I should bring the kids carseats from Norway; not sure how the airlines will treat the seats; and are a bit worried that they will break them.	I am surprised at how many people don't use car seats here in Qatar. Everytime I see one of these little angels bopping around in this traffic it gives me nightmares.	0
What carseat brands are available in Qatar? I´m just not sure if I should bring the kids carseats from Norway; not sure how the airlines will treat the seats; and are a bit worried that they will break them.	"This is one of my pet peaves...back home (Houston; Texas) children;according to their age; must be in a car seat. Knowing that this law does not exist here and how upset I would get; my husband warned me before hand; ""Now; you're gonna see a lot of children that should be in car seats and they're not."" NOT having children in carseats; in the event of an accident; can lead to paralysis or even death. Everyone should wear their safety belts. SAD STORY: (I was a high school teacher) One of my students; Eric; had just earned a full football scholarship to the University of Texas. One night; he was in the backseat of a mid-size car and had fallen asleep and was not wearing his seat belt. The driver of the car Eric was in was in an accident..another driver had run a red light and side swiped their car. Eric was the only one rushed to the hopital. The others had been wearing their seatbelts and were not injured. Eric was paralyzed. Consequently; he was not able to play ball for UT. The UT law....."	1

I´m just not sure if I should bring the kids carseats from Norway; not sure how the airlines will treat the seats; and are a bit worried that they will break them.	Cynbob: My children are not to ride in a car without the right carseats. My first thought was to leave my car seats her in Norway; so that when we come for a visit the grandparents have seats for them. If I can´t be sure to get well known car seats in Qatar; I will bring the seats that we have here. A little more luggage; but nothing is more important than the safety of the children.	1

Nothing is more important and I believe that you and the others that utilize their car seats for their little ones (and big ones for that matter) are setting a great example...maybe it will actually ""catch on"" here! ;) Sad Memory: I remember getting to the hospital that night after another teacher called with the news. The rest of the family was there as well...how tragic...in time; the news spread of how a fellow classmate; a close friend to many; was not going to be able to walk and play ball. Others vowed to ""buckle up"" as we say in south Texas. They had learned a hard lesson. If this story helps even one person remember to take the time to use seatbelts/car seats...it was worth sharing. The Good News: He went on to complete his degree from UT. I last heard he was in law school with hopes of becoming a lawyer specializing in defending rights for the disabled."	0

To think that poor boy had the rest of his life ahead of him only to have it all disappear because he didn't wear a seatbelt. Who could have imagined that would have ever happened?

What carseat brands are available in Qatar? I´m just not sure if I should bring the kids carseats from Norway; not sure how the airlines will treat the seats; and are a bit worried that they will break them.	Why are people so careless with the lives of their children? I can´t undestand it. My mother-in-law walked the streets in our smal town; with a stroller; for four hours while she waited for me to get out of work; just because she didn´t know if she had put the seat in the right way; she didn´t take the chance. Never gamble with your childs life; I could never live with myself if something happened to any of my children because I didn´t use a car seat.	0

Hi everybody As everybody know; that beach is just a big dump of trash. Why we don't organize some kind off group that could take care; clean and protect the beach. Do anybody know where to start; and do we need authorization from the Government to take some action; like grade and clean the beach? Some money will be needed; if there is a start point I can participate with 1000 rials.

Maybe it seams like a crazy idea; but Qatar deserve it; not just come here and take the money	I go there almost every weekend; cause I plan to do some Kite There are broken glasses; bottles; tires; carpets; plastic bags everywhere; month of May is long gone. I think renting a heavy machine to grade; and remove all the trash; was a morning job; and everybody will profit it. Is unbelievable; the amount of broken plastic chairs; and stuff you can find there. I think the beach deserve our respect and protection; I'm not criticizing; but the damage is done; and action and not words need to be taken; every time I go there I bring my trash; and some times pick some plastic bottles around. Now there is a big dump of sand; maybe for construction. In a Country almost like an Island; not having a proper beach to go; is a shame. I can use Hotels; but to be honest for example the beach of the Resort in Messaid is worst; not only the trash but boats and jet skis like fly's. Check mate.....	0

I for one ALWAYS pack out my garbage; always bury and disperse my campfire and practice zero impact camping and picnicking. I know many others that do the same but the amount of litter I've seen thrown out the window of Landcruisers suggests that prevention needs to be seen as the biggest part of the solution. Please don't try to lay guilt trips on me for these ones. When I start to see convoys of Qataris taking pride in and cleaning up their own country (and not paying Sri Lankans a pittance to do it for them); I'll gladly stop and lend a hand. -- Since Allah has given me a brain; it would seem like a sin not to use it.	0

There are no sharks but there are Channa Fish at Dukhan. Beware of Channa Fish! They are very dangerous; especially during the onset of winter. They generally don't attack humans; but if they are hungry they may eat humans! This happens especially when the Channa grows old and lazy and doesn't want to hunt; then they come near the beach to grab easy prey(the human bathers). If you want to be safe from the Channa eat lots of Garlic and apply Garlic spray on your body because; the only thing that can repulse a Channa is Garlic! Have a nice swim at Dukhan! Cya.	1

Hi can anyone tell if its okay to do overnight at umm bab beach? thanks!	hello there; as i do live in dukhan for quite long time; i don't recommend you camping at um bab beach. nothing serious about it but normally people don't camp there!plus safety wise your gonna be far away from dukhan if you need assistance.not good location too i guess around there to camp; but just wanted to let you know since you've asked; you could try further down dukhans beach after the beach house (after the QP sailing club)if you know what i mean good clean spots you could always find. anyways good luck mate have fun!	1

I have just had a call from Nissan Service Centre (Ind area) about the cost to fix my AC on my car - just shy of 20;000QAR!! Call me old fashioned but does this not seem rather alot to pay and it was almost as if the guy was glad to be telling me; like he was proud to rip off his customers. Please tell me this is not so; any thoughts out there as to somewhere else to take my car???	Nissan is a rip off; get your car fixed outside for fraction of the price. To fix your ac they will tell you ten other items need to be replaced; plus labour charges and you will end up keeping your car with them for a week or so. For 20k you can buy another second hand car :P	0

Make sure you don't use to small or too large a pot for your house plants; I have kept plants in their same container for 10 years and they are fine depends on the plant.  Also you mentioned manure; you don't use manure on indoor plants; I hope you meant soil. I also use a liquid fertilizer once in a  while and I save water bottles and fill with water and leave for my house plants that way the chlorine goes out and the temp is room temperature when you water once a week.  Sometimes the plants you get here are not good quality when you buy them so it doesn't take much to kill them.  I had gardenias in the house and within a few months they had outgrown the pot; root bound so I planted them outside in a big pot and they are great now. There is a garden club here you can join and get help and then you will know what plants are easy to grow; like the spider plant cleans your air so its good to have as a house plant.	1

Please anone explain me regading Homoglobin bcz Doctor told me your homoglobin is low! thanks	Heamoglobin is a component of the blood. If you are deficient in it; it means that if you have an accident or cut yourself; you will bleed easier and for a longer period of time.	1

Please anone explain me regading Homoglobin bcz Doctor told me your homoglobin is low! thanks	My mistake; confused this with the condition Haemophilia.	0
Please anone explain me regading Homoglobin bcz Doctor told me your homoglobin is low! thanks	Hi; I am sure most of the guyz answered your query; if you need more details; read the follwoing: The role of the red blood cells is to carry oxygen through the body. The red blood cells can perform this task because of the presence of hemoglobin; the pigment that is formed when the red blood cells develop in the bone marrow. Each hemoglobin molecule is made up of a protein molecule called globin and four pigmented molecules of a compound called heme. Each heme molecule has one atom of iron; and there are four heme molecules in a single molecule of hemoglobin; hence; a single molecule of hemoglobin has four atoms of iron. This structure makes it possible for one hemoglobin molecule to join with four oxygen molecules to form a substance called oxyhemoglobin. This reaction is reversible; enabling hemoglobin to pick up oxygen when the blood is in the lungs and to release oxygen in the cells when the blood is pumped to the tissues. In general; the blood of men usually has a greater concent.....	1
Please anone explain me regading Homoglobin bcz Doctor told me your homoglobin is low! thanks	"Hemoglobin is a protein that is carried by red cells. It picks up oxygen in the lungs and delivers it to the peripheral tissues to maintain the viability of cells. Hemoglobin is made from two similar proteins that ""stick together"". Both proteins must be present for the hemoglobin to pick up and release oxygen normally. One of the component proteins is called alpha; the other is beta. Before birth; the beta protein is not expressed. A hemoglobin protein found only during fetal development; called gamma; substitutes up until birth."	1
Please anone explain me regading Homoglobin bcz Doctor told me your homoglobin is low! thanks	Hemoglobin is the protein molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to Heart and to continue the Inhaling and Exhaling Proccess. They are responsible of Healing any kind of cut ; they stop the blood flow and they are also reponsible to open any kind of plaque inside vains to prevent heart attacks. IF you smoke Hemoglobin will carry the necotin every where it goes because Necotine get stuck on the hemoglobin and reduce its functions so the hemoglobin wont be holding much oxygen in every breathing proccess thats why we see people who smokes breathes more than natural people when they do any activity . There body needs Oxygen but the hemo. aint functioning in the way they have to .	1

Well..LP...understood but there are maybe's here in particular that desalination of seawater and brines within particular WHO regions and globally is a large and rapidly growing process for producing new drinking-water. There is a clear public health and environmental protection argument for providing guidance on production of desalinated water for drinking-water. There are certain chemicals and microbes that are of particular importance in desalinated water. Of these; particular concern has been expressed regarding the presence of microbes due to blending of final waters that; because they were derived from coastal and marine sources; may not be adequately addressed. Similar concerns have been noted about particular chemicals in source water or that are not well removed by the desalination process.	0

How long does it take to drive from Al Khor to the Ras Laffan area? If Doha is 75 minutes away; it sounds better to live in Al Khor or somewhere like that; and go to Doha on days off; right? What do you think?	0
Hi; if you are to work in Ras Laffan; do you live there; too? Are there housing accomodations in the RL industrial area? If I look at a map; the drive between Ras Laffan and Doha looks to be 60+ minutes. Is this true? So if you live in Ras Laffan; what is the entertainment like there?	it depends on the company u r working with ; mostly all company have their own  accomadation camps inside there and they have their own entertainments inside the camp; they will provide transport for the persons to go to doha... but mostly they have a shedule for that ;;;; my opinion is to 50--50 chance ... bcz some can enjoy ; some don't feel.... the one main thing if u need to save money ; this is the best place .. bcz here no way to spend much money ; so u can save;; if ur target is on that........	1

If I look at a map; the drive between Ras Laffan and Doha looks to be 60+ minutes. Is this true? So if you live in Ras Laffan; what is the entertainment like there?	Yes; saving money is the priority . But I was just wondering what a person does around Las Raffan if he's on single-status and he finishes work each day. Are there some simple restaurants to go to if you don't want to cook dinner at night? Or; are there cafes to walk to just to relax? I'm not interested in any heavy disco scenes . Are there neighborhoods in Al Khor? Usually if there are neighborhoods; there are small shops and cafes; right? Is this what the place is like? Thanks for the help.	0

I've worked in oil camps before so I know what you mean about adjusting to the life. In other words; there is no way to take a bus or taxi to any small town that is nearby - like Al Khor - just to get away from the work site for a few hours? Sometimes it's good to get into a different scene for a while. Is there taxi service outside Las Raffan?	0

If you have a car you can drive out of Ras Laffan. Some companies provide cars for employees to do this.

I thought if was a good starting point; since there seemst to be an organised group with membership for parents who teach curriucula full-time at home. On the other hand; your daughter is only three and from my experience (as a nursery teacher) at this age you should foucus on language development (not sure how many languages you teach to your child; but it gets more difficult if you are exponsing your child to two or three different languages); abc's and letter recognicion including reading small words and recongnising her own name in writting; counting and number recognition; colours;shapes arts and crafts and pencil control for tracing lines; numbers and letters.

I've homeschooled my children (now 10 and 12) their entire lives; so I've done pretty extensive research on homeschooling there. There is a Yahoo group for homeschoolers in Doha. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/DohaHomeEducators/ You could start with some basic info there. It's a pretty flexible group that meets whenever some member decides to set something up. Just about homeschooling in general: 3 is very young to begin formal schooling. I think I would focus on letting your child explore the world and reading lots of good books to her. But if you are determined; here's a good resource for younger kids: http://www.fiarhq.com/B4FIVEINAROW.html If you have any other questions; feel free to ask. Homeschooling has been a great experience for us. My husband's company has offered to pay for their tuition to a private school in Doha; but we are opting to continue homeschooling because it has been such a positive thing.	1

In the Philippines there are more schools that caters children with special needs.If we educate them;they can be independent in time as they grow old. Try to search for the movie I am Sam;its about a father with mild mental retardation who nurtura and love his child.He works a lot to earn for a living to help him send her child to school and to have better future. This is a touching and heart pounding story how a mental challenged father strive to have her little girl. Hope you like this film.	0

We Indians have been able to contribute only because we have got slapped in home & school. We are here in GCC as the greatest demand work force in all areas in terms of skills; tolerance; business; management and above all compatability; because we have been slapped. This has given us the name of biggest and trustable employees among all the nationalities & are at par of all as per the GCC nationals say so. I'm proud we are Indians. Don't get dragged away by stupid man made rules when the creator has asked us to teach behaviour whatever way it applies. Kids are very soft and I like them more than you people who look really less matured to pass such comments.

In what religion or what part of quraan or bible God has told u to slap ur kid. I don't think God would love the kids to be slapped. in addition; hitting kids is affecting him/her psychologically and make them lose their self confidence and can suffer from depression. is that what u want for ur kid??? fine; but u slap ur own kid. don't let a stranger slap ur kid for u.	0

Also I have read sometimes that a 6 months deposit is need?? This seems very steep!!	Lincoln you really dont have a clue do you; every time I read a comment from you it is rubbish. The banks do not let them cash and if they do they are liable to be sued by the account holder. A post dated cheque is post dated for a reason. If you cant comment effectively dont add anything.	0

Cheques will be encashed immediately on presentation at a bank irrespective of its issuing date; according to the relevant provisions of Qatar’s Commercial Law; which takes effect on May 13; 2010. According to Article 580 of the Commercial Law of Qatar (Law No.27 of 2006); the cheque shall be ‘payable at sight’. In the event the cheque was presented before the date set as its issuing date; the instrument shall be paid on its presentation date. If a cheque bounces for lack of funds when presented at a bank; the drawer will be liable for its value and he/she may be prosecuted; convicted of a penal offence; fined or imprisoned; sources said yesterday. The provisions of the law take effect in May next year following the expiry of the three-year period notified after its implementation. The law was issued on July 27; 2006 and implemented six months after gazette publication. Effectively; the system of issuing ‘post-dated’ cheques will get scrapped with the law taking effect; a sen.....	0

I noticed many people do not respect local Qataries or they do not respect the country. They come here without having an idea about our culture and religion. All they think about is how much salary they will take. We as a Qataries feel worried about the thousands of outlandish people and we try to be open with others but if they respect our culture and our land. What do u think..?	thats not true. who told you that? i'm working here so i respect qatar. team applei.ph For your iphone needs! :P	1

"""The Star and Crescent signifies concentration; openness and victory; as well as sovereignty and divinity. According to tradition; in 339 BC a brilliant waxing moon save Byzantium (now Istanbul) from attack by Philip of Macedon. To mark their gratitude; the citizens adopted the Crescent of Diana as the city's emblem. When the city became the Christian Constantinople in 330 AD; its Crescent assumed the significance of an attribute of the Virgin Mary. In 1299; conquering what is now Turkey; Sultan Osman had a vision of a crescent moon stretching over the world; it thus became a symbol of the Ottoman dynasty; and when Constantinople fell to Muhammad II in 1453; the crescent came to represent both Islam and the Turkish empire. The star was added by Sultan Selim III in 1793 (its five points being established in 1844)."" Source : ""Signs & Symbols; page 42; by Clare Gibson"	1

Is there any of this on a regular basis? A friend in Qatar has said there is ballroom dancing and Salsa; is that the case? gwaguk	"as everywhere ... there were some ppl dancing salsa @a private party the other day ... dunno if you'll find a proper ""dancing party"" but you can always organise events at your place among ppl who love to dance ! christophe"	0

If your coming from Outer Space you need to find the Virgo Supercluster first; then within that the Virgo cluster. Once you found that look out for the Local Group. In there is the Milky Way galaxy. Some 27.000 lightyears from the center is a small star with eight planets. Go to the third one from the sun and find the continent of Asia. Look at the western portion and identify Qatar. Then find Doha. Once you are in Doha and found the Land Mark Mall enter the new highway. You will soon see the American Embassy on your right. If you pass it you have to do it all again.	1

Had anyone taken rides with Karwa's new franchised taxis operated by Al Milllion? I have yet to take a rdie in one of these new franchised taxis. So I don't know about their services. Are the drivers better behaved than those from Karwa or Mowasalat? Wonder whether Mowasalat had made any effort to oversee complaints regarding Al Million in order to further enhance the quality of service. Any comment?	the problem with these new taxis are they are not that familiar with the roads of qatar.. i got one of them but wasnt able to ride just because the driver didnt know the way.. so do i.	1

I've tried Al Million Taxi so far it was a good experience. The taxi was on time; there was a text from them prior to the agreed time and the name of the driver with the plates. The meter was on and the destination was plotted in their metering machine. But yes since the driver was new he was'nt familiar with where I was going so I have to tell the directions. Other than that I have no problem with getting a taxi from them!	1

Wonder whether Mowasalat had made any effort to oversee complaints regarding Al Million in order to further enhance the quality of service. Any comment?	I wanted to talk about this topic anyway. Yesterday I took a Million cab from Lulu to just two signals away(Near Falcon Petrol Station). He did'nt know where mall round about is. He did'nt know how to change lanes. The lady behind honked like hell and showed her sour face through the window. Somehow I managed to reach my house..I feel pity for these drivers as they are very new to this place and desperate to make a living. Hope it goes well after sometime without too many casualities... The taxi was new and clean. The driver was courteous and very obliging.He only took 10 Riyals; where Karawa guys take 12- 15 Riyals. I welcome Million Taxi; with all its faults. Doha really needed a competitor for Karwa.	1

They show their respect to costumers not like the old karwa taxi drivers which are arrogant and this new million taxi; they are not choosing their costumers! They charged us an extra 4riyals because they had two meters running. one is always 4 riyals and the other one start at 4 riyals. This is way better than the ole Karwa Taxi's! i hope they'll maintain their good image though.	1

The only comment i can make is that last Friday morning from decoration roundabout towards the Ramada Juction; one decided that he would try and cut me up and flash lights/honk horn etc. Anyway his number plate should you wish to travel with the uneducated sod is 3203. I have passed this to the police; thought that it may be better for me in the long run instead of ripping the ba@$#&%s head off... happy motoring.	0

I should save this thread for future updates when these nice and polite drivers get a taste of how to rip people off in Qatar.

Hi;  I love cocking Thai food; but don&#39;t know where in Doha I can find Thai Food grocery shops for the cooking ingredients.  Also; where are the Thai restaurants? Appreciate your information. Thanks	I too love to cook thai food; while living in AbuDhabi I brought a very good step by step cook book and it also tells you what you can use if you can't find what you need. The Mega Mart has almost eberything including the paste for tom soup;but they are closing on the 13th tomorrow. They will probably send all there stuff to the other one. Alot of fresh stuff can be found in large supermarkets. We love the yellow curry which I replace with shrimp.That receipe book has been a big help.Go to Thai Choice website for more receipes. Kathy {new here and still looking for these things too.}	1

hi all; where can we get decent fruits and vegetables? (the ones at carrefour are just really bad) and also decent fresh bread.... thanks in advance!	Some of the stuff in Carrefour is aweful; but most of it is ok. Just cos it doesn't all look shiny and identical doesn't mean it's bad! I find the little corner shops usually have better stuff though; but obviously it costs more; otherwise try the fruit & veg market off Salwa Road. For bread; PQ; Paul and Cafe Bateel do nice stuff; but again it's expensive.	1

My wife and I will be moving to Qatar in September; can anyone give us some info of what to expect and basic advice? Also I am an ex pro footballer looking for a decent standard football any clues to contacts etc and how i get involved out there?	Lewis first of all;wellcome to Qatar in advance;you will slowly find out that Qatar is a nice and safe place to live and raise your family as well.The weather here in September is quite pleasant;but a bit humid.When you are in public;be sure not to wear clothes that offend local customs and traditions.Women can wear what they like but again;it shouldn't be too revealing or transparent.More importantly;to avoid unwanted attention from other men.You say you play football;you can join QL football group;you will updated on whats happenning around Doha;football-wise.And btw;which team do you support?.

My wife and I will be moving to Qatar in September; can anyone give us some info of what to expect and basic advice? Also I am an ex pro footballer looking for a decent standard football any clues to contacts etc and how i get involved out there?	LewisHamilton; Here is an honest report: Be prepared to often put your patience levels beyond your limits in many daily situations. The driving here is insane and extremely risky. The professionalism levels are quite substandard when compared to the developed world. Services here are generally very poor. You will witness all around you; extremisms of social segregation and exclusion; where laborers and maids are marginalized and excluded from the main stream society. During the summer months (May to September) the heat is extreme; it can reach + 50 C. Many people leave Qatar and those who stay; stay indoors. During those months; life is all about work; home and shopping malls. No rain and sand storms instead. Your home and car will be covered with fine brown dust (as thin as cement or talc powder) when can damage your electronic appliances and your health. You'll always have to be aware and think of how not to offend (such as what you wear; what you say; what you drink and eat and when.....	1

My wife and I will be moving to Qatar in September; can anyone give us some info of what to expect and basic advice? Also I am an ex pro footballer looking for a decent standard football any clues to contacts etc and how i get involved out there?	In private (hotel) beaches; both for men or women; there are no restrictions (just like elsewhere). In public beaches; for men there is no restrictions. For women; its not so much about the official restrictions; its more to do with the fact that many people (guys) are not prepared (educated) to behave in the presence of a women in a bikini. Reactions and consequences may vary.	1

Mostly any beach in the Mediterranean Sea; some in Southeast Asia; South America and Australia... just kidding. Beaches here look nice in pictures but often there are not that great (mainly because of the sand which is earthy dusty and the extreme heat starting in May. Here in Doha city; they destroyed all public beaches and all we have left are the hotels (Intercontinental Hotel; perhaps the most popular; not necessarily the best as the beach is artificially prepared the sea floor is construction debris covered with algae. Recently they have built a series of artificial beaches; between the Intercontinental and the Pearl; in Qatara (a cultural village partially operating). The beaches are prepared to be public but they are subjected to a cover fee. All these beaches are artificial so expect dusty sand and sea bed with construction debris. If you want a natural sandy beach with the desert dunes in the back set; you need to drive to the Sealine (you need a 4x4). There are a few others s.....	0

I know that inline skating; jogging; biking ect... are ok basically anywhere in Doha but skaeboarding always seems to get a bad wrap wherever I go.  Is this the same in Doha?  Im not talking about destroying property or anything like that but it is often view that way while im simply entertaing myself the same as the rest.  Please do not suggest dune surfing; that looks like all of 5 seconds of fun.  Thanks all!	honestly ... i dont think i have seen anyone skate boarding here... but i know there is a shop on salwa road (i think thats were its at) i used to do agressive skating and there are alot of good places here to do some good stuff... i think if you just be respectful to people and dont make a big scene about it ... then no one should care... besides... even if they do say anything whats the worst that could happen... if there is no sign around... the worse they can do is tell you to leave...  ____________________________________________________ just hanging out and watching dvd's with helen keller... kind of a quite night.	0

Hello; How safe is it for ladies to move alone? Do Indian ladies move freely and alone on their own or by public transport / taxies? We are used to UAE life which we feel safe. Is it comparable? Thanks	Qatar is no longer a safe place to live in when compared to what it was before. Seeing is believing. The other day my wife was just waiting for me to take the car out from the parking area of our flat( she was standing inside the parking area but she was busy on her mobile ) when a guy in a Honda Civic stopped and asked her to hop in. Do you call this safe. I have seen this happening to so many women in Qatar. No one is trying to scare away people it is the fact. Please open your eyes and dont go by statistics.	1
Hello; How safe is it for ladies to move alone? Do Indian ladies move freely and alone on their own or by public transport / taxies? We are used to UAE life which we feel safe. Is it comparable? Thanks	Bibs; your topic message above is not really accurately describing safety in Qatar. This instance; that happened with your wife; almost happens almost everywhere in other countries. If I am taking a cab in Cairo; where I live; I will get tons of offers to hop into someone’s car. Not necessarily because I am pretty; but because girls are hit on generally speaking. I’ve been here in Doha for a couple of years; with family or without; faced the usual hassles. Downsides: Persistent car followers. At malls guys throw their cell phone numbers at girls. In bars some guys impose themselves; but usually there are guards. On the beach guys stare and offer company with no pressure. On the Cornich (for long walks; jogging and workouts) guys may try to talk to her. But if the girl is serious enough; no one can catch up with here speed to begin with; unless he is a highly athletic trainer or something…) Generally men stare; specifically from certain down trodden ex-pats from some least deve.....	1
Hello; How safe is it for ladies to move alone? Do Indian ladies move freely and alone on their own or by public transport / taxies? We are used to UAE life which we feel safe. Is it comparable? Thanks	In the last 4 years I have gone to the vegetable market/ the souqs the corniche and everywhere in between many times alone. I am a blond decent looking westerner. Have I got stared at---always and it creeps me out; but never have I felt unsafe. I keep my head up; walk fast and in a confident manner. No one would dare mess with me is my attitude--it seems to work so far.	1

Hello; How safe is it for ladies to move alone? Do Indian ladies move freely and alone on their own or by public transport / taxies? We are used to UAE life which we feel safe. Is it comparable? Thanks	I am more than surprised to see all these comments; living and working in Qatar as a blond woman; I have to admit I have never encountered any of the above mentioned. Even going to the Fruit and Vegetable Market; where in any case; it is much better if you have company with you; not because people stare; but they are used to dealing with men as mostly on Friday the men do the shopping. Wherever you go; if they recognise you are foreigner;(because you are different) they will look at you and the inflation will rise 200% in every shop (at least they will try). Qatar is no different than any other country but a lot more safe if you behave naturally you will not be molested. One thing more - on the streets it is very much a mans' world and your will see relatively few women going alone shopping; so for many people this is really strange. I go to a small supermarket nearly everyday to buy milk and the boy insists on carrying the one bottle to my car; this alway makes me feel foolish as I am.....	1

Hi there I m pretty new to this place..... The world is getting small these days..... Although preoccupied with work ; are there any decent places to hang out here? Where can w find females for a date? How to go about it?	I have been here for about 8 months; I know a bit about the place. There are a few good bars to go to to meet new people. Of course you want to meet women. I hear the Qube is a good place to meet girls. You could try your luck there. Where have you been?? I don't want to tell you places you have already been too. Ask me any questions and I will try and answer them for you.	1

Hi there I m pretty new to this place..... The world is getting small these days..... Although preoccupied with work ; are there any decent places to hang out here? Where can w find females for a date? How to go about it?	Ok; well there is Garveys; a british run pub. More casual. You can sit down talk and drink they usually have a band playing. There is also Palomas; however you need a female with you to get in. Aussie bar this is in Rydges hotel; same deal as palomas you need a woman with you. What sort of music you into? At the Diplomatic Club they get djs from all over the world. It is usually house music. They also have hip hop nights. Shit I think the Qube for males is about 80QRs; of course free for woman. Your right you know; we are treated with so much more respect here than in my home country.	1

This has the advantage of opening some doors to you; if you are willing to go through any. like 25 points is the minimum you need I happened to learn to be a member of the book club. otherwise I have not read (could have missed though) anything about getting a prize with your points.

My family and I are moving to Doha from the U.S. soon. What are some of the activities for teenages; ages 14-17. I have two in that range; and they enjoy sports...mostly tennis and soccer.	Doha has an overdone of sporting facilities! The Doha Asian Games are next year which means there are a lot of sporting facilities and events happening. Also; there are a number of sport and health clubs that you can join. Soccer is big here and the season is starting soon. Qatar has a number of big names playing in the local league (usually end of career European and South American players who are lurred by the big bucks). The ATP Tennis Tour also visits Doha and entrance to matches are free!	1
My family and I are moving to Doha from the U.S. soon. What are some of the activities for teenages; ages 14-17. I have two in that range; and they enjoy sports...mostly tennis and soccer.	I personally think there's lots for a teenager to do here. I think it's mostly like most western countries with the exception of all the bad influences (No alcohol in grocery stores and such). Apart from the sports that have been mentioned a billion times; there are a lot of other ones that anyone may join and most of the time get coaching for free. Golf; archery; shooting and a lot of other ones that are completely free. For the not so sport oriented teen; there's the Scientific Club which is like a club that allows members to expand their scientific abilities. The Scientific Club will die out soon as the new Science and Technology park is opening up soon and lots of major corprations such as Microsoft and Dell are taking part in it. Movies aren't half bad either. The real blockbusters make it here within a week; while other not-so-good ones make it here in 2-3 weeks. There's also Alladin's Kingdom which is an OK theme park. Isn't as great as many others but it's OK. This won't last l.....	1

Why TATA SAFARI is not available in Qatar??	I dont think it is available in Qatar. Chk at the Tata showroon in Salwa road.	1
Why TATA SAFARI is not available in Qatar??	Hmm for a second there; I thought TATA's did something crazy and actually launched the SAFARI in Qatar! Its enough I saw a couple of Scorpios on the road and I had to duck behind my steering wheel! Thank God it isnt so :) SAFARI is only good for India; gives the Indians a feel for BIG car.

Why TATA SAFARI is not available in Qatar??	Tata cars do not have quality; none of them ever: The Estate; Sierra;Safari; Indica .... ...Avada Kedavra..	1
Why TATA SAFARI is not available in Qatar??	"TATA are known to be a business house with solid Ethics.. TATA cars have proven to be success in Indian MArket. There Indica was the only car in India which challenged the dominance of Maruti Suzuki 800; which was enjoying the maximum market share. TATA NANO has shown to the world their Engineering superiority. Something even the Germans or Japanese Couldn Do. Safari is a Good Vehicle. But the problem in Qatar is - People are not hardworking enough to actually see which vehicle does well on road... They follow the crowd... n Also there is blind following of American Brands n Japanese... You sell a toy car labelled ""made in America"" And the so called Qataries will buy tht in Whole sale.. to boasts About tht fact tht they own American Stuff.... Why you think Skoda is not a much accepted brad here very much like TATA.... First see the vehicle and then Comment.... If a vehicle can run on Indian Roads (sorry not roads.. supposedly roads) It can drive in any country ;... trust me...."	1

This was a new one to me.. Apparently; if your relationship is in a rut; then one idea is to issue your partner with a ""Hall Pass"". This allows him/her a few days of freedom to do whatever they want. no questions asked. Sounds dangerous to me; but what say you. Would you issue your partner with a ""Hall Pass"" ?"	"No; since when does ""doing what ever you want"" help to fix a relationship? It's just carte blanche for cheating...and cheating makes things worse; not better. IMHO"	1

If the 'Hall Pass' is for them to go on the lash or a weekend away with mates or some R & R away from stresses; then sure he could have a Hall Pass - as long as I got one too.

One should always be able to do what one wants to do; even if one is in a relationship. If it is a good relationship; one will not feel that there are uncomfortable restrictions. Being in a relationship should not mean one has to give up ones life or personality. If it feels that way; then maybe one is with the wrong partner.	0

"the ""Hail Pass"" gives you carte blanche without any questions - so it is different from being able to do things freely within a relationship.

No one can force to change your religion; don't be afraid. We are all pray to the same God; the different are the way how we do it. There are no such force converting like you said. Religion is faith that comes from your heart; and what you feel in life. As long they teach good things which can make your life better; keep away from sin; it's fit for you.	0

Today's Gulf Times carried an article where recommendations were made to make arabic language and sharia compulsory in curricula of all expat schools in Qatar.

Of course he should learn about Islam; but not as something he needs to submit to; but something he should have knowledge about. The same goes for Sharia law. We do indeed live in an Islamic country; so it is important to be familiar with Islam. I like that Arabic is taught; the more languages a person knows;the better. The only problem I have is that so far all the Arabic teachers we encountered are totally useless.	1

How do QL'ers with school going kids feel about this? Make your opinions heard.	Isobel said R.E ... In order to teach religion effectively there has to be comparatives. What I mean by this; when explaining to children the various nuances of religious beliefs one has to show a comparative and what that comparative means to that particular religion. If we are going to go down the route of teaching religion in this country we are going to have teach ALL religions; in order to get the history; culture and meanings of what each religion means to that particular one and how in some cases some religions are tied to each other through geographical circumstances and culture and how indeed they came to be that Religion. There will have to be healthy debate and in some cases at High School level; debate as in e.g. Islam and Christianity. Would that work? I think in ex-pat schools it may but in some local private schools; I doubt it. However; if by religious education they mean telling a few stories from Koran to incite a healthy interest in the local religion; it could work......	1

"I can't think of a good argument against learning the language of one's host nation (provided; as Isobel said; that a student can handle the academic rigors of such a class). Sharia? I'd personally have a problem with that being mandatory. Because Sharia is a code of law based upon a specific religion; it would only be acceptable to me if it were taught as an elective comparative law class; say; for high school students. Then it would be appropriate. If instead of Sharia; you meant they should be teaching all children Islamiyat/Islamic Studies classes; then you'd get a vehement NO from me. Unless you're going to couch it in a ""comparative religion"" class that EVERYONE has to take; then why should my child have to sit through a class that will amount to nothing more than religious indoctrination to a faith that I don't subscribe to? I would be more than happy for my child to take a class on ""history of the Middle East and the Islamic World"" or ""Arab cultural studies"" (and much like an A....."	1

GCC countries normally had 5 years validation of drivers license; but in any case you change your employer; it should be re-validated under the new sponsor. Better discuss it to your company HR; before you accelerate your car.	0

 anybody can advise me a trick to get driving licence on parking test? thanks	if its parallel parking I can tell you what my driving instructor taught me: drive up parallel to the car in front of the spot you want to park in; about a foot away from it. reverse straight until you can see the boot of the other car through the back door window then turn the steering wheel and straighten it back up as you move. when the back; driver side corner of your car is in line with the car behind you; turn the wheel the other way and viola!! you slide right in.	1

 anybody can advise me a trick to get driving licence on parking test? thanks	First prepare yourself and ignore the police when he shout so you don't feel nervous. Make sure you don't knock over any pole. Begin Reverse 2 inches away from the pole in your right hand side. When you don't see the first corner of the pole of the parking box covers by the part of the car; take a full turn to the right. Adjust your mirror on the left hand side down to see the white line; then reverse slowly. When you see the white line in the middle of the left back wheel; take a full turn to the left then move slowly then you will be inside the pocket parking. I hope it helps!!!

I have visiting visa for work; so can I drive; I have egyptian license?	NO. you cant drive with other then GCC license. I also think that I can but law is clear. You need to make all procedure to exchange or make Qatari an driving license. Be sure all stories that you can drive is wrong. If you make any accident then you will see the problems. Best wishes. p.s. if you go to make driving license and you fall...make like I was...give to Sudani man big boss there some money and this is it. I give 1000 QAR and in 3 time I get licence. This is not secret just life in Doha. Corruption every where. Can you imagine that I fall 2 times at driving tests like I dont know how to drive... I have in my 50 years more then 20 diff. nice good cars... and I have more then 26 years driver lic. and more then 1.000.000 km behind me in all Europe countries... Not like new comer Indian people who use bicycle before and now make so many accident in Doha. Every day I see 5-6 accident. Driver? So sorry just true-Indian. GOod luck in driving with proper documents. Penalty is tooooo .....	1
I have visiting visa for work; so can I drive; I have egyptian license?	If you are on a visiting Visa and and you have an international driver license you can use it for 6 month I guess. If you get the permanent residence you can not use the Int driver license anymore.	1
I have visiting visa for work; so can I drive; I have egyptian license?	Mr.Calculator consumes major space for the same answer which is not helping the person with right answer?!; you can not drive a car with Egypitian licence here; as a visitor first 10 days you can drive but later you need to take a temporary driving licence for 3 months. you have to pay 100 riyal for every month and need to take eye-test for this licence.	1
I have visiting visa for work; so can I drive; I have egyptian license?	"I totally disagree with ""Sun Fun Sea"" all the major accidents are not caused by Indians; may be Indians invloved in this accident because of the other party (most of them are locals with crazy driving) and you can see majority in Qatar are Indians that is why you can see more Indians involved in accidents; but not all their faults; and all Indians are not riding bicycles in their past that is because of your lack of knowledge about India. What was the vehicle you used in your country before invent cars? be logic and dont generalize people with your lack of general knowledge."	0
I have visiting visa for work; so can I drive; I have egyptian license?	No; you cannot drive; you should have a GCC license not Egyptian.	1

I visiting Doha for a week and intend to rent a car. Is it legal to drive using USA Driver License or do I need and international one?	Even if you have a International License; you need to get a temporary license from Traffic Department. When you are in Doha; get the application for temporary license and submit it to the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department along with copy of your US license and passport pages showing your identity and visa page You might need to get an NOC from the sponsor (Typed in Arabic) if you visit here under visa from some company or sponsor. Best way is to ask the rental car company to assist you to get it.	1
I visiting Doha for a week and intend to rent a car. Is it legal to drive using USA Driver License or do I need and international one?	If you in vist visa you can drive; but if you want to cavnt to qatari ; so you can apply easly just vist to traffic dept and ask for new one.	1
I visiting Doha for a week and intend to rent a car. Is it legal to drive using USA Driver License or do I need and international one?	Supposedly the US license is good for (7) days. An international license is good for (6) months. They are easily obtained from AAA for about $15. After (6) months and likely before then you would need to go for a Qatar drivers license.	1
I visiting Doha for a week and intend to rent a car. Is it legal to drive using USA Driver License or do I need and international one?	The last answer in regards to needing translation and all this paper work.I call BULLSHIT. It enoys me this advice which would take your time and is not true. All you need is your lie. from the states;if it makes you feel comfotable and its easy for you to get international then do but don't sweat it. When you come out of arrivals you will see a dozen car rentals;grab one of them;easy way to do it.And screw buddy and there shit advice....dam it bugs me.Incompetence.	0
I visiting Doha for a week and intend to rent a car. Is it legal to drive using USA Driver License or do I need and international one?	I recommend that you go to a AAA agency and get an international license. Driving here in Doha is pretty dangerous- so I recommend you take every measure to protect yourself. It is pretty easy and not costly. See you when you get here!	1
I visiting Doha for a week and intend to rent a car. Is it legal to drive using USA Driver License or do I need and international one?	I believe you will be OK for seven days. I think you must also carry your passport with you when driving.	0
I visiting Doha for a week and intend to rent a car. Is it legal to drive using USA Driver License or do I need and international one?	Sorry for my earlier post. I didn’t completely check the week’s issue.

The do a great job; and I know lots of people who take their animals there. If your dog is social; he can play with the other dogs each day. If not; he can stay by himself. They cater to each individual animal and know them by name. (I'm ""Rackety's owner""-- they know him; not me!) The only catch is that they book up really far in advance. Call as far in advance as you can to book your space. Website: www.ppkdoha.com You can see photos of the place and get all the details there.

Rescuing a dog - or any other living creature for that matter - is a great thing; and you remember the hadith of the prophet(pbuh) of the woman who give water to a thirsty dog ... etc.	0
Hello QatarLiving! My family and I will be away for vacation. PLEASE tell me about the reliable places in Doha where you put your dog in when you’re out of town!! I don’t know where to take him and I don’t trust anyone to do that for me :-(	"dogs in Islam are acceptable so long as they serve a ""purpose"". In my own home; they provide security. There are steps to take in the Muslim faith so that dogs are allowed (concerns washing dishes; the person if touched; etc.) My main concern is that this has been allowed to be interpreted as dogs are ""haram"" - and some people take this as a reason to be cruel and abusive. One (western) person I know said that this was due to ""Arab cruelty"" (his words; not mine); I in turn replied ""I feel sorry for those who think lke that (and you) because some people (and not just those of the Muslim faith) do not know how much security and real affection dogs can give - they are always happy to see you no matter your state of mind or emotions. All they ask is sufficient food; water; to be treated without pain or hurt; and a few kind words."""	0

So order that the head of the statue be broken off so that it resembles the trunk of tree; that the curtain be cut and made into two pillows to recline on; and that the dog be taken out.' This prohibition is limited to keeping dogs without need or benefit.	0

The health certificate needs to be within one week but the vaccine has to be given at least 30 days before travel. It's not recommended to breed and sell puppies here - there are far too many irresponsible people who get bored and abandon them. Come down to the rescue shelter when you get here and you'll see the number of pure-bred dogs that were abandoned because they got too big; or too energetic; or because their owner was going on vacation!	1

i want someone to share my life with... but i want labrador retriever.. is there any chance i can find here in qatar?	He's going to his new home this weekend. Why do you want a labrador? Have you had experience with this breed before? Labradors are far from easy to keep and need a huge amount of exercise so they don't get destructive. Have you had dogs before? Where will it live? Have you thought about what you will do when you go on vacation? Or leave Qatar for good? Have you looked into all the costs involved with having a dog - from adoption fees; vaccinations; food; boarding kennels etc.	0

By the way; she's just your girl friend not a lover yet; right? Is it difficult to reply her offer(saying thanks darling; sweety but i cannot eat balut; sorry! thats it. or eat it later by yourself; lets have some biryani instead) because its like your so afraid...of lossing her. Have you smell the BALUT??? Try it first! Your term Kick her??? mmm... such ridiculous man. How handsome are you by the way? and by the way; does your girl friend knows that you post your BALUT issue here? If she know am sure she will kick you out first before you act.	0

i am a chinese girl now working in shanghai for an American website:www.smarter.com i just graduated from university majoring in english;working in different country is my dream;can someone give me advice what job i can do in Doha;and is it hard to live in the city? are there some good websites for applying a job in Doha? thank you for your time!!	I would advise you to pick a different place. Many people will view you as nothing but a prostitute in Qatar. Yes Doha is a tough city to live in and the cost of living will cause you to save little to nothing each month. Plus they aren't going to pay you what you're worth because you are Chinese. Chinese are put into the lower-income bracket in Qatar - that is just the way it is over here. Not fair; I know. If you do go...don't let them take your passport from you because then you may find yourself working at the Oasis just so you can buy back your freedom. I hope this helps. Sage	1

Thank you for your advice;it is really helpful;Also;i have a different thinking about the city now;but if i have chance i still will go there. the reason why i go there is not for money;and i can have a good life in China;and i only want to work one year there;i just want to enrich my life;know more about the world;like now;i know their attitude about chinese girls;hooker;i think there must be some Chinese people do it there; but not all!what others look at me is not important;the point is that i know what i am doing. i know that is a rich place because of oil; but only rich material life;shanghai people is not that rich; but i really suggest they can visit here; they will know how wonderful this city is; how great the people is and how happy the life is.money is not everything; it is only one tool for us to reach happiness;and i am happy now. people there can look down upon Chinese people;it doesn't matter;cause we are so proud of ourselves.	0

Honestly; if you want to enrich your life then Qatar is the worst place I can think of; honestly. Qatar is the definition of an empty shell. Nothing of substance here whatsoever. Here you have an entire displaced foreign population - all here for working only! There is no culture here. Work is the culture. As for the geography...the worst found anywhere in the world. No trees; no rivers; no lakes; no mountains; lots of traffic though; terrible climate; etc. etc. Combine that with no fun at all; unfair pay based on your nationality; and the surrender of your passport. If that is your idea of enriching your life... go for it!	1

Lots of jobs.... Salaries in the same field vary a lot with nationality. Qatar taxes income by housing rent (50% mininum) so if you manage to get a job make sure the company houses you or at least pays you the amount of your rent (even if it increases). You will need QR 1000 for food & other expenses if single. Anything above that you can save; depending on how much you want to save. I would say the minimum one should ask for should be QR 2000 above the Rent; else you would be really wasting your time and youth. Although there are Construction workers who work for QR700 which would be roughly what they earn in their own countries.(SriLankans & Nepalis mostly come here to get away from the civil war in their countries so they are willing to work for so low.) Qatar is booming in 2 sectors Oil/Gas and Construction. 1st is Nationalised so you may find it difficult to get into. The second is not a boom its a BLAST. Theres always jobs in Construction Companies. All other services are growing.....	1

This is a complicated society but it can be very enriching. Try spending a weekend in the desert with a Qatari family; attending a Magilist; learning Arabic; learning to dive; going fishing and sailing with Qataris. I have done all of these things. It is not easy to make the connections; you have to make the effort but like many other things in life; the more effort you make; the better the rewards. I think you do most things here that you can do anywhere else. I admit; I miss mountains and climbing and greenery but there are plenty of good things here and some very fine people. Just go and out and find them.	1

"Undoubtedly you can experience new things and enrich yourself in Qatar; as in any other country for that matter; but the question here is another in my opinion. We cannot pretend there are not issues in this place; specially if you carry the ""wrong"" passport; so I think it is fair that Maggie gets the full picture; both the rosy and the dark side of Qatar. Then she can make up her mind."	1

Then logically; the universe is supposed to come back to its original state at some point of time..who knows. I have tried but could never understand 'quantum Fluctuations' which is said to be the reason for the big bang out of a singularity. Further; the 'anti-matter' and 'negetive energies' are still theoretical concepts. If the same are proven someday; it would further help us to understand if the universe will die at all. But; at present; it is a general opinion that universe will keep on expanding and may freeze out when all stars would become either black holes; neutron stars or white dwarfs.	1

Allegedly from Dr John Smith of the athiest society. http://www.qatarliving.com/files/image001_23.jpg	At one point in their history Sikhs were either hindus or muslims There religious teaCHER declared himself as a prophet of sorts and Now an interesting fact Adi gRanth takes most of its principles from the Quran; so its no biggy that it mentions the Big bang and the round earth(though in the Quran the shape is of a sphere which is more correct) etc. The book was compiled by studying the faith of islam with two of his muslim friends namely Sheikh Farid; and Kabir. He never claimed divinity though but installed the principle of One God (Same as Islam) and the priesthood (Not important in Islam atall).	1

Allegedly from Dr John Smith of the athiest society. http://www.qatarliving.com/files/image001_23.jpg	Yeah it's the answer. It makes complete sense to never ever cut your hair and wear a big bag on your head to keep it in. I'm sure whichever supernatural god fairy that created the world and the universe is going to absolutely demand that we all have really long hair or they'll be no afterlife for us. Please stop being so blind all of you. There is no god; you're going to die; live your one life to the fullest; enjoy bacon; get pissed and cut your hair	1

Hello guys..I want to take NHA licensure(Nurse) here in Qatar but I dont have any work experience in the Philippines..I'm currently working here now as a nurse in a construction company for almost 1yr..Will NHA allowed me to take licensure here even if I don't have the necessary experience required? Help please..thanks a lot and godbless..	You must have two years of work experience to apply for the license. You can work for another year and carry on with it. Since you are on company sponsorship I think you can work for another year and then apply. Hope this helps	1

Of course this helps me..so you mean for the meantime I cannot apply for the licensure exam at NHA since i dont have enough work experience? and I can add another year then use it as my work experience to apply NHA exam? thanks again for noticing this..	0

Help please..thanks a lot and godbless..	You shouldn't be working ANYWHERE in Qatar WITHOUT an NHA license;so continuing in your current job for another year & then showing that to NHA as work experience may not be the best idea because as of now you are working ILLEGALLY!...you need to have minimum 2 years work experience OUTSIDE Qatar before coming here;if you could be employed legally here without an NHA license;what's the point of them conducting the exam???...so if you want to legally work in Qatar;go back to your home country(doesn't matter where as long as you work LEGALLY.);get two years LEGAL work experience then come back here;get your degree;certificates & work experience reviewed by Dataflow;then apply to take the licensure exam...	1

That's the reason why I wanna know if I can still take NHA licensure even if I still don't have any working experience in the philippines but currently working here..because when I was hired here I don't think that time it was mandatory so I was hired when they implemented that license here..thanks for replies guys; much appreciated.. :)	0

Help please..thanks a lot and godbless..	I think work experience is not a prerequisite for taking the NHA exam that is now handled by Prometric. You can try to schedule the exam online. However; there's no point of taking the exam without the required work experience since it is one of the requirements to get NHA license. Moreover; if you pass the exam; the validity is only for 2 years; otherwise you have to take it again.	1

Thanks ecabs..so u mean i can take NHA Exam without the necessary work experience? the validity is 2yrs so it wont be a problem as long as i pass it..getting the NHA license can come later; what i really wanted to know was if I can take the exam or not..anyway it was a lot help thank u..	0

Help please..thanks a lot and godbless..	you can take Prometric exam without experience. My exam's validity is 3 yrs... There are many nurses out there are working without license. Private clinics are very strict on accepting new nurse applicants. Your lucky to practice your profession with license here; but beware my friend... You need to be extra careful bec. that's ILLEGAL	1

Just heard from QBS radio... so now i wonder what love really is? Or why do we consider nationality; jobs or special things as a category...?	"Considering nationality; income etc is a smart thing to do IMHO. Nationality differences can lead to disputes about where you will live; if it is accepted to the family; if you will be able to get your spouse into your country and many more. As for financial status; love is great but it doesnt pay the bills. I for one wouldnt want to have a future with someone if we didnt have a pot to p*ss in or a window to throw it out my entire life; but I guess thats just my female gold digging instinct. I love the fact that someone stated that we girls/ladies are the only ones who see their potential partner as an investment. _____________________________________________________ ""Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"""	1
Just heard from QBS radio... so now i wonder what love really is? Or why do we consider nationality; jobs or special things as a category...?	brit.. i'd add to your list: a real love is UNRETURNED one.. if we love with the condition that he/she loves us in return; it is already Conditional love.. how many times we hear: ”Oh; he is bas**rd; he doesn't give you what you deserve; LEAVE HIM”.. it is initially wrong.. if you are with the person just for RECEIVING what you “deserve”; it is not love.. It is a contract...love is GIVING without expecting anything in return.. The PEAK/TOP of pure love is when you keep loving the person even knowing you will never get anything in return; and even knowing you will never be together… This is a real LOVE with NO DOUBTS.. ********************* “You become responsible forever for what you have tamed”.

The Arabic alphabet doesnâ€™t have the letter P.

Batman; a provisional driving licence-holder; was found to be over the drink-drive limit. Superman; who held a full driving licence; was also breath-tested and found to be the same. Both men have now been charged. The pair were among 15 people who were arrested in Fife as part of a clampdown on drink driving. Fife Police said the pair of superheroes were stopped near Anstruther in the early hours of Sunday morning. The two men; both in their early 20s; were on their way home from a fancy-dress party when they were ordered to pull over. A source at Fife Police said: ""This is a real fall from grace for two superheroes. I am sure drink driving is not allowed in Gotham City; and it is certainly not to allow....."	0

I am not really sure of what i said; but; one thing is sure; if you need it in big quantity; you should have taken a permission from authority..   "" There's nothing we can do to change the past; if it teaches  you a lesson profit from it then; forget it."""	0

This question is a just a diversive way of saying that Filipinos do eat dog meat. Come on; look around and be good to people. asking a question that you know the answer is 5tup1d1ty.

A friend of mine lost his dog; when he searched for it other said it has gone to stomach of neighbor filipino.; so I began enquiring about it and an filipino engineer told me the dog meat is extra special meal for our wedding ceremonies.; Still i am doubting about? is there any true in it?	"Vma; in Nagaland(India); they feed the dog some spicy food and then force it to wash it down with some strong alcoholic liquer. Then they take the dog by the tail and give it a vigorous swing and shake it until it becomes sick and throw up. They collect the vomit and leave the dog alone and the vomit is used as a topping for a very special rice dish during ceremonial feasts. And BTW; they eat dogs;crows;rats etc in some parts of the north east too. So ""dog meat curry"" and ""dog puke"" is an Indian dish. I have heard that other Asians like a some Koreans(not all) and some Japanese eat ""dog meat"" too. Exotic food is popular in many Asian country. But Filipinos do it ""field rats"" and ""snake meat""; if I am not wrong!"	0

"I am INDIAN; and agree with Carlester ... it was a indirect question ""Does Philipinos eat dot meat"".. there are lots of stories going around the way Filipinos eat. Can someone put some light...which are the meat popular in Philipines..( apart from chicken; mutton; beef; pork ) it may clear lots of doubts ( including mine ! )"	0

I think you are getting confused with Pig. Pig is served on Philipino weddings. Dogs are not eaten by Filipinos as far as I know. Curry is an Indian dish not a flilipino dish..	1

I am now revising my plans to wait for promotion or season where the price is discounted. Can anyone help me when will be the best time to buy a Car? Further clarifications would be; would it be best to buy during Ramadan; last quarter of the year; etc.... Thanks in advance.	The best time is when you actually need it.	0

If you go for a new one and maintain it well; the car should not give you problems for a couple of years.	1

You will get good resale for any Toyota. And an older Camry is nothing to worry about; a 2009 Camry is pretty much just starting it's life..4 years is nothing for a Toyota engine and there are Camrys with 800000kms still running around happily with no problems..You'll probably die long before your Camry does haha	1

My budget is arrount 45K And what I found in market is either : Camry 2009 or Corolla 2012 So what do you think ? Thank you	just make sure that whatever car you decide to buy; has a full service record and stay away from cars with unknown histories..a car is only as good as its maintenance and even a Camry/Corolla has to depend on its owner to take care of it. You can take it for an evaluation to the Bosch Service Center where for 500 Qr. they will give you a bumper to bumper report on the condition of the car..you'll need to leave it with them for half a day though..I suggest its money and time well spent to ensure you get a good reliable car.. Best of luck	0

So ; if you wish to spend 5 k extra ; then head for AA Abdul Ghani building ....... or with help of a friend use QL classifieds and select yourself but in this case you need free time to check & inspect the cars conditions and negotiate rates with half dozens sellers before you will find the best one ....

I'm looking to by a new car; but the local GM dealer is useless and looked at me like I'd asked for a turbocharged donkey when I said I wanted a manual gearbox. So; I've seen the car I want in Dubai. Is it possible for me to get a loan here; buy the car from Dubai; import and then register it here; or will the bank not allow it as the car isn't in country? Thanks	take a personal loan for the amount needed for the car... You can then have the money paid to your account and you can do with it what you like:-)	1

Sooooooo; it is possible to take a personal loan and get the car. Might have to investigate this a bit further :) Saeedkan; you'll have to show me this trick of eating the wrong way. I thought there was only one way :)	0

Thanks	Hi Alan; you might wanna re look at the difference in intrest rates between a car loan approx 3.4% as compared to approx 9% for a personal loan. If you check with manager (not sales guy) of GMC they can get the car down from DXB for you. I hear the drive down is no fun either and not too safe too. Just curious why would you like to drive a manual car when you can go in for a triptronic instead. With the increase in traffic an auto is de way to go (just my oponion)	1

Is it possible for me to get a loan here; buy the car from Dubai; import and then register it here; or will the bank not allow it as the car isn't in country? Thanks	Mandilulur; ignore the profile; its nonsense. I refuse to post anything remotely truthful about myself on a public forum. My name isn't Alan either; but it'll do for this forum :) B2D; driving is always fun; I love cars; always have. Plus its an adventure; never done it before :) Cy; I know about the rates; but the actual monthly payment costs aren't too different; yes I pay more overall; but I can accept that for the convenience it gives me in choosing the car I want. I'm a Brit; I grew up driving manuals and its a more compelling experience than having an automatic decide when to change gear. I bought the car; I'll decide when to change. Personal opinion on Triptronics is they are there for show; and they still aren't as good as a manual box. The wannabe Schumacher's of this world can have them; I'll stick with a standard 6 speed box thanks. Easier to hang the arse out of a RWD V8 when you can control the gearbox; not a sodding computer. :)	0

Thanks	its was rather weird when I saw your exact name on one of my twitter followings.... apparently you are Katy Perry's favourite comedian;-P I have to agree with you on manuals... yes; I am a chick; but I do know a bit (very small amount) about cars... I also drive a manual and when I went to buy it and insisted on it; the salesman was surprised that I would ask for manual over auto... Besides what you have said regarding manuals... they are also easier to push start should the need arise;-P	0

Which is the best Pakistani School for children in Qatar? Thanks	Frankly speaking; all pakistani schools suck . as none of them have any standard if we compare them to the Indian schools. However; out of the available one; Bright future is the best. DO not go for a lower fee paksitnai school as PEC would be the lowest. If you can afford; get your children in private school like Cambridge etc or otherwise Bright Future is the best.	1
Which is the best Pakistani School for children in Qatar? Thanks	There are three Pakistani schools here in Qatar.. PEC; Pakshama and Bright Future and to be honest; they all suck big time. I studied in Pakshama from 80 to 88 but it wasn't so bad that time. We had mostly Indian teachers so the standard of English was pretty good. But then somewhere end of the 80's or beginning of 90's they removed all Indian teachers and hired Pakistani teachers so their standard detoriated in a few months. I shifted to PEC in 88 or 89 and I was shocked to see Pathan teachers who could not speak or write English properly. They were pathetic in grammar and pronunciation. In 1996 I got a job at Bright Future when they had just opened. I have seen their method and standard of teaching very closely.. They are just as bad as the other two. I would advise you to send your children to some international school if you can afford or else to one of the Indian schools.. There are five of them here and all are equally good.. MES Ideal Indian School Shantinekatan DMIS DPS By the .....	1
Which is the best Pakistani School for children in Qatar? Thanks	My eldest son is at Bright Future Pakistani. Honestly; I am not satisfied with the school. They dont have good standard. My son is having problem with his study there. Lack of attention from the teacher and lack of skill of teaching also. They dont have activities to boost the interest of learning for the kids. lack of creativity. Too much URDU Lesson (which I dont understand how to help him with his Urdu homework). If you lucky; your child will be teached by skilled teacher (my son had a very nice and good teacher when he was at KG2 at the same school). Unfortunately this year for grade 1; he's stuck with unskilled teacher :( Indian school? yes they are good; but very difficult to get space. We've been trying for a year now. NO LUCK !! Other international Schools? They suck our blood out ! One thing good is that we can afford the fee of BFS. (My husband is a Pakistani but I am not)	0
Which is the best Pakistani School for children in Qatar?

Airport Tourist visa (personal sponsorship) is stopped; and Airport Business visa (Company sponsorship)is still issued.

Today I learned there is no more airport visa; but only business visa and tourist visa. So what to do to bring anyone on a visit?	Some people are giving wrong informations about tourist visa; they cant stop tourist visa as they are promoting tourisum these days; you can bring your relatives only by tourist visa for 14 day and can be extended for another 14 days; after 28 days you need to exit from Qatar to any nearest Airport and can come back again with another tourist visa; this is allowded only 2 exit mean 28+28+28 maximum approx. three months 54 days only not for 6 months as some one says.	1

It’s famous that accommodation is expensive in Qatar; but is that reflecting good standards of finishing; decorations; facilities etc.??? Or there is no relation between being expensive and the quality??	In general the higher the price the newer and better the house/apartment. However note that some new houses have high rents ('cause they're new and big) but are located in crap areas! For a good place in a compound or high building you need at least 15'000 QR; and many of those places already have waiting lists. Prices however are not comparable to rentals in other countries. There's shortage of good accommodations which increases the rates; it's not that housing is better in Doha then elsewhere. If your employer won't take care of it; best is to come here and take a look by yourself... Good luck.	1
It’s famous that accommodation is expensive in Qatar; but is that reflecting good standards of finishing; decorations; facilities etc.??? Or there is no relation between being expensive and the quality??	Luciano From my experience the cheaper places (7-8k a month) have lower quality than the more expensive places (18k for a 2 bedroom). However; do not expect to see excellent quality on the expensive places either because you won't.	0

It’s famous that accommodation is expensive in Qatar; but is that reflecting good standards of finishing; decorations; facilities etc.??? Or there is no relation between being expensive and the quality??	Accommodations of higher rent like 15k to 25k per month will be in better quality than the cheaper ones. It is not necessary that the facilities will be very good if you are paying a bigger rent. I think now a days the rents are depending on the locations and not on the facilities. There are some areas in Qatar where you have to pay 7-8k per month for a two bedroom accommodation and there are some areas where you will be asked for 10-12k for two bedroom accommodation with the same facilities.	1

Why is milk so much more expensive in Qatar than anywhere else? PS This thread is dedicated to Lincoln Pirate ;-)	Some people say because it is imported.

"our kids were there last year; but we have transferred them to a cheaper and better school. Can't say where as 'someone' will work out who i am. Kids did ok; but were not at all challenged. Biggest issue is the student mix and the site. It's too small now (around 200 kids I understand); so they have lunch in the classroom and take turns at playing outside. Quality of ed. is basic. Owing to language difficulties; (loads of Dutch and Danes) it's lowest common denominator stuff. But if your kids are bright; even the schools that are 'closed' will interview and test. Ours are now going to one that has been full for 4 years; but we didn't have to wait as they did v well on the entrance exam. Hamdulillah. And the fees? As said above; ""because they can""..."	1

And what do you do apart from Qling to give an impression of being immensely busy?"	Do you know it is the hardest job on earth????!! We must congratulate those pipol and give them incentives at the end of the day and all... imagine..evryday of your VERY BUSY life you go to office and each day before you go to office you have to think so hard and will give you a big headache later ON HOW POSSIBLY MAKE YOURSELF SO BUSY that the management really see you BUSY and killing yourself by showing them that YOU ARE REALLY BUSY.... but the truth of that matter is YOU R DOIN NOTHIN AT ALL BUT TO WAIT FOR BREAKS; LUNCHTIME AND OFCOURSE THE LAST 5 MINUTES OF OFFICE TIMINGs....loool BUSINESS LIFE WILL BE BORING IF THERE IS NO QL....

Has someone actually died of work ever? I guess I'll be the first one. It's a overnight for me tonight. Just like last two 3 am nights. Have been working continously for three days now. I feel like passing out. There's a board meeting day after and work is only half finished. Is it bye bye Doha time ? I have never been so scared in my life. Give me some sympathy please. Excess QLing has done this to me. I wish I had known better and had not kept backlogs.	Get off QL; and get back to work...:P Salam	0

At least some of us can save our job.	1. keep yourself busy with work. don't mind your others as long as your boss is happy with what you are doing. 2. less talk less mistake. never disclose any of your personal things. the more they know about you; the more they have something to talk about. 3. avoid having too much personal calls and chatting during office hours. they can also look after this. 4. if you want to join with their chats during break time; give them a good story on what happened to your former officemate whom you slammed after you knew she / he was backbiting you. scare them. Show them you are not tnat kind and better for them to be very careful with you.	1

A yearly salary increase would also be a benefit.	1

Ask for 13;000 housing and also a list of schools they will pay for when your child becomes school age (or allowance of 45;000 for schools if you agree to stay that long). And ensure it is a negotiable contract year so you have time to review after you have lived here for a while? Congratulations!	1

I did not like the offer and asked to revise basic salary from 19k to 25 000 QAR. What do you think?	for starters; it is a good package and i believe you should take up the offer. You should negotiate on the part where the company provide insurance for the entire family. No logic in them providing insurance just for you. Second; do negotiate the car allowance coz if you plan to rent a car; a good vehicle; say a honda civic would cost you qrs. 2500. a 4WD would cost you much more. Third; do check where your working base is going to be. Is it in Al Khor? If yes; it is a nice location along with a community where your family will feel at home. I stated Al Khor coz most of the leading big petroleum companies are in the Al Khor side. All the best. Cheerios	1

Hey; can anyone please tell me whether a colour blind engineer is acceptable to QP??	it depends upon the position; for ex; i know for a fact that a candidate was rejected becasue he couldnt spot a shade of green properly; he wasnt colour blind; there was a lot of defence for his case; but he was rejected because he couldnt recognise a shade of green. here it probably mattered becasue he would be working in the lab. so it really depends upon the field of activity.

Hey; can anyone please tell me whether a colour blind engineer is acceptable to QP??	looks like you are refering to a lady engineer; if her work isnt field related; then theres a good possibility of her getting through; moreover if she is really good and the department encourages her case; a lot can happen. because in such cases; if the candidate is really deserving the HR may forward the case to the concerend department to reach a final decision.if the dept insists on having her and that her problem wont interfere with work; then anything is possible. all in its good time. happy heart DRIVE SAFE;someone is waiting for you at home	0

I feel a little foolish asking this. I'm moving to Qatar in a month for a new job. I've never been to Qatar before. Recently a colleague who's worked in Qatar told me that single guys aren't allowed in to malls & other places on weekends.(unless they're accompanied by women or a family) Is this true? If true; do these restrictions extend to coffee shops; supermarkets; movies & other places. Also if true; why on earth is there such a rule?	it's not bad as what you think?	0

I'll be joining Al Jazeera International ; a dream I've had for some time now. I need to ask anyone; employees of Al Jazeera or anyone working in Qatar; what kind of accommodation is provided by Al Jazeera for singles. Im worried that pre-determined accommodation may be unsuitable or in an unsafe neighbourhood. Can anyone help me out on this? Id really appreciate it. Thanks	I don't think you have anything to worry about. We know a couple of Al Jazeera Int'l employees and they were given really great spacious furnished apartments (I think they were 3bdrm). And then those that had family accommodations were given villas in a great compound.	1

I also had the same concerns about the accomodation. Does anyone know if the accomodation that is given to employees is in a specific compound or area; or do they have a network of landlords on their books and choose that way; and does that mean the apartments could be anywhere in the capital? cheers and all the best	0

Thanks	aljazeera is an equal opportunity company so your nationality should not matter; I also got a job offer there and am still waiting to finalize things. I already visited the company and I was thrilled with the place and the employees; they are extremely nice and helpful which you don't really find in much TV stations so it is a blessing. As per your concern about accomodation; from what I heard is that all employees who are married and have children are provided with a very decent villa in a compound and single employees are provided with a 3 bdrm furnished apartment in a nice place as well. After all aljazeera has a big name and I dont think they will throw their employees(their best resources) in a place that is unfit or unsafe. Good luck and I hope to see you there.	1

You often find that when Megamart get something new in they slap a ridiculously high price on it in the hope that people will just buy it (which we often do; clearly). But I've quite often seen that a few weeks later the price is drastically reduced; sometimes halved; presumably because not enough people were buying it at the ridiculous price.	1

I normally boil the water that comes in big CANs + bottles..I dont use it directly for my 7month old baby..The brands like MASAFI; RAYYAN; MANHAL are safe; as far as i have used it for my baby since her birth..But yes; as a precautionery measure; i do boil before adding SIMILAC powder..	1

It's a bit more expensive than other water but it's worth it and you find it in all Carrefours. You can never be sure about other producers here unfortunately...if you decide to go for another brand; make sure Sodium content is less than 20. We just arrived here a month ago from the UK too and my 6 months old is on Evian. My 5 year old was also on it when she was little. Also; what formula are you using? they are not always identical to UK ones. I tried Nestle's NAN but it gave her green poo so we switched to Aptamil and she seems to be fine now. I don't know if it's your first baby but in case it is - don't worry to much about what is so called ""recommended milk intake is"" - both my daughters always took at least 30% less than was recommended for their age and their weight has still been absolutely normal. Feel free to send me a personal message if you need more advice."	1

Maybe your grandson still adjusting with the situation and the weather here. Because it happened also to my baby when we were travelling. She didn`t drink her milk like before; but after few days everything is back to normal. And for the water i recommend Nestle; or Masafi. Good luck	1
